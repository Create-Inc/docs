An iframe lets you display your Anything app inside other websites - like embedding a YouTube video. This means users can interact with your app without leaving the host website.

## Getting the embed code

Get your app's embed code in two steps:

1. Open your project and change to Code View
2. Select **Embed Project** and copy the iframe HTML code

</Steps>

## Customizing the embed

You can modify how your app appears:

- Change `width` and `height` in the iframe code
- Set a custom `title` for accessibility
- Add CSS classes for styling

### Example Code

```html
<iframe 
  width="560" 
  height="315" 
  src="https://www.create.xyz/app/e19f4e2a-9063-4180-ba9f-7c7028ccd2a3" 
  title="My Site">
</iframe>
```

<Note>
  If you are working with a wordpress.com site, you may need to use a [plugin](https://wordpress.com/plugins/iframe) to get the iframe to display.
