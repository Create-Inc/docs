title: "Embed an iframe"
---

1. [Publish & Share](/create/publish-and-share)

Add your Create app to any website using iframes

An iframe lets you display your Create app inside other websites - like embedding a YouTube video. This means users can interact with your app without leaving the host website.

### Getting the embed code

Get your app's embed code in two steps:

1. Open your project and click the **Share** button

2. Select **Embed Project** and copy the iframe HTML code

![](/images/create/publish-and-share/~gitbook/image)

### Adding to WordPress

Here's how to add your app to a WordPress.org site:

#### 1. Click "Share" then "Embed Project" inside your Create project

![](/images/create/publish-and-share/~gitbook/image)

#### 2. Copy the iframe HTML code

![](/images/create/publish-and-share/~gitbook/image)

#### 3. Inside your WordPress site, add an HTML block

![](/images/create/publish-and-share/~gitbook/image)

#### 4. Paste in the iframe HTML code

![](/images/create/publish-and-share/~gitbook/image)

#### 5. Adjust the height and width, if needed

![](/images/create/publish-and-share/~gitbook/image)

### Customizing the embed

You can modify how your app appears:

* Change `width` and `height` in the iframe code

* Set a custom `title` for accessibility

* Add CSS classes for styling

**Try it yourself!**

Here's a sample embed code to test:

```
<iframe width="560" height="315" src="<https://www.create.xyz/app/e19f4e2a-9063-4180-ba9f-7c7028ccd2a3>" title="My Site"></iframe>
```

*Note: if you are working with a* [*wordpress.com*](http://wordpress.com/) *site, you may need to use a* [*plugin*](https://wordpress.com/plugins/iframe) *to get the iframe to display.*
