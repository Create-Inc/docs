### Routes and URLs

Routes determine how users access your pages:

- `/` is your homepage
- `/about`, `/contact` etc. for other pages
- `/api/[function-name]` for published functions

Routes make your content accessible at yourdomain.com/route. For example, publishing a page to `/about` makes it available at yourdomain.xyz/about
