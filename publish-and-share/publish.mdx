### Routes and URLs

Routes determine how users access your pages:

* `/` is your homepage

* `/about`, `/contact` etc. for other pages

* `/api/[function-name]` for published functions

Routes make your content accessible at yourdomain.com/route. For example, publishing a page to `/about` makes it available at yourdomain.xyz/about

### Managing Published Pages / Functions

Control what's live by toggling pages and functions on/off. Unpublished items become inaccessible.

Remember: After making changes to your pages or functions, you'll need to republish for them to appear on your live site.
