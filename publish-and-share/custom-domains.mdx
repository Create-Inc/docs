## What is a custom domain?

A custom domain lets you use your own web address (like `yourapp.com`) instead of the default `created.app` address. You'll need to:

- Own a domain (purchase one from providers like [Hover](https://www.hover.com/) if you don't have one)
- Have an Anything Pro subscription ([upgrade here](https://create.xyz/pricing))
- Have an app ready to publish

<Note>
  **Important timing notes:**

  - DNS changes can take up to 48 hours to take effect
  - During this time, your domain might not work or might show old content
  - If it's been 48 hours since you'd added records and published your domain, reach out for support
</Note>

## How it works

When someone visits your domain:

<Steps>
  <Step title="DNS Lookup">
    Your domain provider checks its DNS records
  </Step>
  <Step title="Routing">
    The records point visitors to Anything's servers
  </Step>
  <Step title="Delivery">
    Anything routes visitors to your published app
  </Step>
</Steps>

DNS records are like an address book for the internet. They tell browsers where to find your app when someone types in your domain name.

## Setting up your domain

<Steps>
  <Step title="Publish your app">
    [Publish](/publish-and-share/publish) your Anything app
  </Step>
  <Step title="Configure domain">
    Select "Publish to a custom domain" in the Publish modal
  </Step>
  <Step title="Add DNS records within your hosting control panel from your provider">
    Add these DNS records **_at your domain provide_**r:

    ```
    Type: A
    Name: @
    Value: 76.76.21.21
    ```

    ```
    Type: CNAME
    Name: www
    Value: cname.vercel-dns.com
    ```
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Note>
  **Using a subdomain?** For addresses like `app.your-domain.com`, just add one record:

  ```
  Type: A
  Name: subdomain-name (e.g., "app")
  Value: 76.76.21.21
  ```
</Note>
