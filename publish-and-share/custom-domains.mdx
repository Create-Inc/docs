## What is a custom domain?

A custom domain lets you use your own web address (like `yourapp.com`) instead of the default `created.app` address. You'll need to:

* Own a domain (purchase one from providers like GoDaddy if you don't have one)

* Have a Create Pro subscription ([upgrade here](https://create.xyz/pricing))

* Have an app ready to publish

**Important timing notes:**

* DNS changes can take up to 48 hours to take effect

* During this time, your domain might not work or might show old content

* If it's been 48 hours since you'd added records and published your domain, reach out for support

## How it works

When someone visits your domain:

1. Your domain provider checks its DNS records

2. The records point visitors to Create's servers

3. Create routes visitors to your published app

DNS records are like an address book for the internet. They tell browsers where to find your app when someone types in your domain name.

## Setting up your domain

1. [Publish](/create/publish-and-share/publish) your Create app

2. Select "Publish to a custom domain" in the Publish modal

3. Add these DNS records at your domain provider:

```
Type: A
Name: @
Value: 76.76.21.21
```

```
Type: CNAME
Name: www
Value: cname.vercel-dns.com
```

**Using a subdomain?** For addresses like `app.your-domain.com`, just add one record:

```
Type: A
Name: subdomain-name (e.g., "app")
Value: 76.76.21.21
```

## Provider-specific setup

  <Accordion title="AWS Route 53">
    *Follow the instructions below for AWS Route 53*

    **Step 1:** Create a new record

    ![](/images/create/publish-and-share/files%2Fv0%2Fb%2Fgitbook-x-prod.appspot.com%2Fo%2Fspaces%252FhtL7VuGp0gBcXZ6RdKx1%252Fuploads%252FwS1LfV8PAZYYcdy0VPSx%252Fcreate_record.jpeg)

    **Step 2:** Select `A` for the record type and set `76.76.21.21` for the value.

    ![](/images/create/publish-and-share/files%2Fv0%2Fb%2Fgitbook-x-prod.appspot.com%2Fo%2Fspaces%252FhtL7VuGp0gBcXZ6RdKx1%252Fuploads%252Fg3TVDjU2OdFaAeGoQnM5%252Fapex.png)

    **Step 3:** Create another new record like in Step 1

    **Step 4:** Select `CNAME` for the record type, set [`cname.vercel-dns.com`](http://cname.vercel-dns.com/) for the value, and set `www` for the subdomain.

    ![](/images/create/publish-and-share/files%2Fv0%2Fb%2Fgitbook-x-prod.appspot.com%2Fo%2Fspaces%252FhtL7VuGp0gBcXZ6RdKx1%252Fuploads%252FtHza7kV8rMXjfE7JvUJs%252Fwww.png)

    In the end, you should have two additional records like here:

    ![](/images/create/publish-and-share/files%2Fv0%2Fb%2Fgitbook-x-prod.appspot.com%2Fo%2Fspaces%252FhtL7VuGp0gBcXZ6RdKx1%252Fuploads%252F4gzyd4aFkKohKxq0D6Bg%252Fend.png)

    **CAUTION:** There should be ONLY ONE `A` record. If there is already one, please remove the old one.

    **Important:** You may not be able to see your live domain for up to 48 hours, as it takes time for the records to update and become active.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="GoDaddy">
    *Follow the instructions below for GoDaddy*

    **Step 1:** Navigate to the Domains sections

    ![](/images/create/publish-and-share/files%2Fv0%2Fb%2Fgitbook-x-prod.appspot.com%2Fo%2Fspaces%252FhtL7VuGp0gBcXZ6RdKx1%252Fuploads%252Fnc54YXMsoq7NMyqvsWw7%252Fwhere.png)

    **Step 2:** Press `Add new record`

    **Step 3:** Add these two records like in the picture:

    ![](/images/create/publish-and-share/files%2Fv0%2Fb%2Fgitbook-x-prod.appspot.com%2Fo%2Fspaces%252FhtL7VuGp0gBcXZ6RdKx1%252Fuploads%252FWLtOK0UXGZE10d2U24Fw%252Fadd_records.png)

    In the end, you should have two new records. It should look like this:

    ![](/images/create/publish-and-share/files%2Fv0%2Fb%2Fgitbook-x-prod.appspot.com%2Fo%2Fspaces%252FhtL7VuGp0gBcXZ6RdKx1%252Fuploads%252FXQWj4uc149fcuSfTsl5G%252Fend%2520%281%29.png)

    **Important:** You may not be able to see your live domain for up to 48 hours, as it takes time for the records to update and become active.
