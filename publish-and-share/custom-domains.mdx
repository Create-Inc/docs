## What is a custom domain?

A custom domain lets you use your own web address (like `yourapp.com`) instead of the default `created.app` address. 

<Tip>
  **Free hosting option:** You can always publish your app for free using a `your-app-name.created.app` subdomain. Custom domains are optional and require an Anything Pro subscription.
</Tip>

You'll need:
- An Anything Pro subscription ([upgrade here](https://create.xyz/pricing))
- An app ready to publish

## Two ways to get a custom domain

You have two options for setting up a custom domain:

### Buy a domain directly through Anything

The easiest way to get started! You can reserve a domain directly through our platform when publishing your app. This option handles all the technical setup automatically - no DNS configuration needed on your end. We'll reserve the domain, configure it, and connect it to your app seamlessly.

**Quick steps to purchase a domain:**

1. Head to the project you want to purchase a domain for
2. Click Publish
3. Click on "Get a custom domain"
4. Find the domain you want by searching for it
5. Click on the domain you want to buy
6. Click Confirm

<Tip>
  Domains are purchased through our partnership with Name.com. Payment is automatically charged to your payment method on file with Anything.
</Tip>

### Bring your own domain

If you already own a domain or prefer to purchase one from an external provider (like [Hover](https://www.hover.com/), [GoDaddy](https://www.godaddy.com/), or [AWS Route 53](https://aws.amazon.com/route53/)), you can connect it to your Anything app. You'll need to configure DNS records at your domain provider (detailed instructions below).

<Note>
  **Important timing notes:**

  - DNS changes can take up to 48 hours to take effect
  - During this time, your domain might not work or might show old content
  - If it's been 48 hours since you'd added records and published your domain, reach out for support
</Note>

## How it works

When someone visits your domain:

<Steps>
  <Step title="DNS Lookup">
    Your domain provider checks its DNS records
  </Step>
  <Step title="Routing">
    The records point visitors to Anything's servers
  </Step>
  <Step title="Delivery">
    Anything routes visitors to your published app
  </Step>
</Steps>

DNS records are like an address book for the internet. They tell browsers where to find your app when someone types in your domain name.

## Connect your existing domain

If you already own a domain (or prefer to purchase one from an external provider), follow these steps to connect it:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Open your project">
    Open the project you want to publish and click on the publish button in the upper right
  </Step>
  <Step title="Get a custom domain">
    Click "Get a custom domain" in the Publish modal
  </Step>
  <Step title="Connect your domain">
    Select "Connect your domain" and enter your existing domain (e.g., `www.yourdomain.com`)
  </Step>
  <Step title="Add DNS records at your domain provider">
    Add these DNS records **_at your domain provider_**:

    ```
    Type: A
    Name: @
    Value: 76.76.21.21
    ```

    ```
    Type: CNAME
    Name: www
    Value: cname.vercel-dns.com
    ```
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Note>
  **Using a subdomain?** For addresses like `app.your-domain.com`, just add one record:

  ```
  Type: A
  Name: subdomain-name (e.g., "app")
  Value: 76.76.21.21
  ```
</Note>

## Provider-specific setup (for bringing your own domain)
