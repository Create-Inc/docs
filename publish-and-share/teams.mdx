Create lets you collaborate with teammates in real time as you build your app together. Invite your designer, developer, agency, or anyone else to join your workspace.

## Getting started

Invite teammates in two steps:

* Click the **'Invite'** button in a project or from the dashboard

* Enter their email addresses to send invitations

When teammates accept their email invitations, they'll join your workspace and see your projects.

## Real-time collaboration

When teammates join your project:

* See their cursor and changes in real time

* Their icon appears in the top right corner

* Work together simultaneously on any element

The /build URL from the builder stays private by default. After inviting teammates, you can share this link for direct access.

## Managing access

* Teammates can access all projects in the workspace

* Switch between different teams from the dashboard side panel

* Teammates need to accept their email invitation to join

<Warn>
Team member removal isn't supported in the UI yet. Email <a href="mailto:hello@create.xyz">hello@create.xyz</a> if you need to remove someone from your workspace.
