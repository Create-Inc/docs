Create lets you collaborate with teammates in real time as you build your app together. Invite your designer, developer, agency, or anyone else to join your workspace.

## Getting started

Invite teammates in two steps:

- Click the **'Invite'** button in a project or from the dashboard
- Enter their email addresses to send invitations

When teammates accept their email invitations, they'll join your workspace and see your projects.

## Real-time collaboration

When teammates join your project:

- See their cursor and changes in real time
- Their icon appears in the top right corner
- Work together simultaneously on any element

The /build URL from the builder stays private by default. After inviting teammates, you can share this link for direct access.

## Managing access

- Teammates can access all projects in the workspace
- Switch between different teams from the dashboard side panel
- Teammates need to accept their email invitation to join

<Warn>
  Team member removal isn't supported in the UI yet. Email <a href="mailto:hello@create.xyz">[hello@create.xyz](mailto:hello@create.xyz)</a> if you need to remove someone from your workspace.
</Warn>

## How to toggle into a shared account

To switch between different team accounts or shared workspaces:

1. **Navigate to the dashboard** - Go to your main Create dashboard
2. **Find the "My Team" dropdown** - Look for the "My Team" section in the left sidebar
3. **Click the dropdown arrow** - Click the chevron (â–¼) next to "My Team" to open the menu
4. **Select your desired team** - Choose from the available team options in the dropdown

The dropdown will show all teams you have access to, including any shared accounts or workspaces. Simply click on the team you want to switch to, and you'll be taken to that team's dashboard and projects.
