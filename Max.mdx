Max is an autonomous software engineer that builds, tests, and fixes your applications automatically. Give it a goal, and Max will work through your app like a real user, writing code and tests until the task is complete.

## What Makes Max Different

Anything already lets you build products without coding. So what's new about Max?

**It builds for you.**

We gave Max eyes, hands, and more intelligence and autonomy. Max sees and uses your app. It operates on its own live or in the background. Like a real engineer.

**See.** Max runs your app in a full browser. It looks at it the way a user does and notices what happens as it tries it.

**Act.** Max uses your app like a person. It scrolls, types, clicks, logs in, uploads, checks out to try end to end flows.

**Operate.** It keeps going on its own. Goal → try the app → change something → try again, until solved. It sometimes runs for 100+ steps and 30+ minutes (but usually it solves it faster)

So Max is a personal product engineer. It's designed to help the most complex projects. So anyone can get to shipped.
