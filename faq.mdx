  <Accordion title="How do I know if my Apple Developer Account is active? How do I verify that?">
    Please follow these quick steps and let us know the result (screenshots help if anything looks different):

    **1. Check your Apple Developer Program membership**

    Go to: https://developer.apple.com/account

    Sign in with the Apple ID you used to enroll in the Apple Developer Program.

    In the left menu, click **Membership**.

    Check the fields:

    - **Program Type** should say Individual or Organization.
    - **Status** must say **Active** (not Pending, Expired, or Incomplete).

    👉 If you see a button like "Join the Apple Developer Program" or the status is not Active, your enrollment isn't complete yet and you'll need to finish or renew it.

    **2. Confirm you can access App Store Connect**

    Go to: https://appstoreconnect.apple.com

    Sign in with the same Apple ID.

    You should see the main dashboard with tiles like Apps (or "My Apps"), Users and Access, etc.

    👉 If you see a message saying you're not enrolled or don't have access, your account is not yet ready. In that case, please complete your enrollment on the Apple Developer site or contact Apple Support.

    **3. Make sure agreements are active (important for publishing)**

    While still in App Store Connect, click **Business** (top menu).

    Click **Agreements, Tax, and Banking**.

    In the list of agreements, check that:

    - Any required agreements show **Active**.
    - There are no items marked Pending, Incomplete, or Expired and no warning banners.

    If you plan to have paid apps or in-app purchases, the **Paid Apps Agreement** must also be Active.

    **4. What to send back to us**

    Please reply with:

    - Whether your Membership status is **Active** (and Program Type: Individual or Organization).
    - Whether you can see Apps/My Apps in App Store Connect.
    - Whether any agreements are Pending/Expired under Agreements, Tax, and Banking.

    Screenshots of:

    - The Membership page
    - The Agreements, Tax, and Banking page (if anything looks unclear)

    Once all of the above are OK, your account is fully set up and we can publish apps using it. ✅
