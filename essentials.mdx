## Getting started

You chat with Create to build your app. Tell it what to build using **text** or **images** (paste them in).

Speed up with keyboard shortcuts:

* Press `cmd-enter` (or `ctrl-enter` on Windows) to send messages

* Use `/` **commands** to add [Integrations](/builder/integrations) or create new elements

Create projects can contain multiple elements to build end to end apps:

* [**Pages**](/builder/pages) for your app's screens

* [**Components**](/builder/components) for reusable UI pieces 

* [**Functions**](/builder/functions) for backend logic and external API calls

* [**Databases**](/builder/databases) to store information

* [**User Accounts**](/builder/user-accounts) for authentication and users

* and more

When you start a new project, you begin on a single page.

<Tip>
Don't want to start from scratch? Try a [**Template**](https://www.create.xyz/templates). Create's assistant will walk you through customizing the elements of the app.
</Tip>

## Making improvements

Iterate on your app by sending more messages to the assistant. Create updates your app based on your instructions and the current state of the project.

You can change what level of detail you want to work on:

* When you select a **specific element**, messages update only that element

* When you select the **canvas**, messages can modify multiple elements at once

## Version history

As you chat with Create, it saves your version history automatically.

You can:

* Tap on **previous versions** in the chat to view them

* **Restore** any previous version as the current version

## Demo vs. Select vs. Code

You can quickly switch between different modes to work on your app. Learn more about [controls](/builder/controls):

* **Demo mode**: Try out your app's functionality

* **Select mode**: Tap elements to make specific updates, create [components](/builder/components), or add links

* **Code mode**: View and edit the underlying code

## Creating new Elements

Add new elements to your project through:

* Tapping the **top left Logo menu**

* `/` **commands** in the chat. See our guide on [integrations](/builder/integrations)

## Canvas vs. Focused View

Toggle between two workspace views using the collapse icon:

* **Canvas**: See multiple elements at once laid out on an infinite canvas

* **Focused**: See a single element at a time. Focused mode can help to test updates that impact scroll.

## Go Live

When you're ready to launch your app, tap the **Publish** button in the top right. Learn more about [Publishing](/publish-and-share/publish).
