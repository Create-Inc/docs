## Getting started

You chat with Create to build your app. Tell it what to build using **text** or **images** (paste them in).

Speed up with keyboard shortcuts:

- Press `cmd-enter` (or `ctrl-enter` on Windows) to send messages
- Use `/` **commands** to add [Integrations](/builder/integrations) or create new elements

Create projects can contain multiple elements to build end to end apps:

- [**Pages**](/builder/pages) for your app's screens
- [**Components**](/builder/components) for reusable UI pieces
- [**Functions**](/builder/functions) for backend logic and external API calls
- [**Databases**](/builder/databases) to store information
- [**User Accounts**](/builder/user-accounts) for authentication and users
- and more

When you start a new project, you begin on a single page.

## Making improvements

Iterate on your app by sending instructional messages to the assistant. Create updates your app based on your input and the current state of the project.

- Be specific and succinct
- Callout defined areas to the builder if you want specific edits to a certain element or page
- Review our [prompting guide](/prompting)

## Navigating your demo

- Use the top level navigation area to select pages of your build
- As you build, features or pages will be added by the builder. The completion of that work will always have a message in chat
- To preview this you may need to navigate to the sub-area of your demo, login as a sample user in a dashboard, etc.

## Discussion Mode

Put the builder into discussion mode to get input, feedback and best practices information directly from the AI.

<Warning>
  While in discussion mode the builder is intentionally unable to make changes to your project
</Warning>

![Discussion Pn](/images/discussion.png)

- Ask questions of the builder and it will suggest options to you
- Inquire about functionality or mobile compatibility of certain pages
- Turn off Discussion Mode to then give instructions that will execute edits and changes

## Deep Thinking Mode 

We enable this by default to improve the builder experience. The AI agent will work to help you investigate and research questions or commands to the best of its ability, even with off site resources like hosted documentation. Think of it like hiring an expert to approach a query when you're not just trying to instruct an edit but rather discuss strategy, improvements or business goals for your application.

![Deepthink2 Pn](/images/deepthink2.png)

- Ask about improvements for your app or site:
  - "How can I make this site more appealing to investors in x space?"
  - "What key features am I missing?"
  - "I want to integrate with the API at \<place\> can you use this documentation \<link\> to help me build a function to pull in my user data?"

## Generations

When you send a message, Create uses your message, message history, and the app's code history to generate the code for a new version. 

When generating, you'll see the **code stream** or a **building icon**. When it's done, you can play with the app in **Preview or Demo Mode.**

<Tip>
  [Pro members](https://create.xyz/pricing) get better generations - Create uses more history and context to make smarter changes.
</Tip>

<Tip>
  Read our [guide to prompting](/prompting) to learn how to write clear messages that get the results you want.
</Tip>

## Version history

As you chat with Create, it saves your version history automatically.

You can:

- Tap on **previous versions** in the chat to view them
- **Restore** any previous version as the current version use the revert button

![Xnapper-2025-07-08-11.38.06.png](/images/Xnapper-2025-07-08-11.38.06.png)

View your complete version history with the dropdown menu from the upper left of your dashboard or access it via _cmd \+ option \+ shift \+ h_

## View Modes: Demo, Code, and Preview

By default we will always show you the build in demo mode. You can quickly switch between different modes to work on your app. Learn more about [controls](/builder/controls):

- **Demo mode**: the default view, work and test your application while building it right
- **Code mode**: View and edit the underlying code
- **Preview**: A live preview sandbox to view your site as a public user and test functions, authentication, payment systems and more.

## Creating new pages, elements and functionality:

Add new elements to your project through direct instructions to the builder:

- Chatting with the builder about what you need next, such as "Create a new page to handle blog posts" or "Add user accounts to support logins for paid members"
- Use "/" to setup [Integrations](/builder/integrations), or Upload Assets

## Stopping the builder

- If you see a generation making changes you don't want or for any reason want to stop a request from being completed, you can quickly click the stop icon in the builder chat

![Stop Pn](/images/stop.png)

## Refresh your preview

Not seeing a change that was just implemented? Give the demo mode a quick kick with our refresh button in the upper toolbar :)

## Project Settings

Control important project specific settings including assets, secret keys, custom instructions, generation settings, authentication providers, branding, social share, mobile app settings and more.

![Ezgif 6c735490bbae99 Gi](/images/ezgif-6c735490bbae99.gif)

- Assets - upload images to reference and use in your project repeatedly
- Custom Instructions - shape the way the builder interacts with you and your project. This is an advanced feature not generally required for daily use. See community examples of Custom Instructions [here. ](https://www.create.xyz/custom-instructions)

  <Warning>
    Certain custom Instructions can prevent the builder from functioning correctly if they conflict with its default behavior.
  </Warning>
- Generation Settings - Pro users can decide which LLM they would like to have their builder use
- Saved Secrets - API keys stored in the project for integrations
- Providers - Authentication options for user account features, [more info here.](/builder/user-accounts)
- Branding and Icons - mobile app specific resources (more coming soon)
- Social Share - Choose a title and description that appears in search engine results and on social media when shared

## Go Live

<Tip>
  While editing your project you do not have to click Publish to see edits, you can view them in demo mode or the preview option from our top level navigation at anytime. Only publish when ready to share with external parties or take your application live for use by the public.
</Tip>

When you're ready to launch your app, tap the **Publish** button in the top right. Learn more about [Publishing](/publish-and-share/publish).
