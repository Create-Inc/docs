## Getting started

Build your application by conversing with Anything. Describe your requirements using **text** or **images** (paste them directly into the chat).

<Frame caption="Anything builder interface showing the main canvas, chat, and key controls">
  ![Mobile Build Sample](/images/mobilebuildsample.png)
</Frame>

### Keyboard shortcuts

Speed up your workflow with these shortcuts:

- Press `cmd-enter` (or `ctrl-enter` on Windows) to send messages
- Use `/` **commands** to add [Integrations](/builder/integrations) or create new elements

### Project components

Anything projects can contain multiple elements to build end-to-end applications:

- [**Pages**](/builder/pages) - Application screens and user interfaces
- [**Components**](/builder/components) - Reusable UI elements
- [**Functions**](/builder/functions) - Backend logic and external API calls
- [**Databases**](/builder/databases) - Data storage and persistence
- [**User Accounts**](/builder/user-accounts) - Authentication and user management
- **Assets** - Images, logos, and media files

New projects begin with a single page that you can expand upon.

## Iterating and improving

Enhance your application by sending instructional messages to the assistant. Anything updates your application based on your input and the current project state.

### Best practices

- Be specific and concise in your instructions
- Reference specific elements or pages for targeted edits
- Review our [prompting guide](/prompting) for optimal results
- Lean on our [Discussion Mode](/Modes#discussion-mode) to plan integrations, changes or debug issues
- Learn how to [triage issues](/support/help#how-to-triage) with our troubleshooting guide

## Navigating your application

- Use the top-level navigation to switch between pages
- Features and pages are automatically added as you build
- Completion notifications appear in the chat
- Preview functionality may require navigation to specific areas or sample user login

## Code generation

When you send a message, Anything uses your input, message history, and application code history to generate new versions.

During generation, you'll see a **code stream** or **building icon**. Once complete, test your application in **Preview or Demo Mode.**

<Tip>
  [Pro members](https://create.xyz/pricing) receive enhanced generations with more context and history for smarter changes.

</Tip>

## Version history

Anything automatically saves your version history as you build.

### Version management

- Tap **previous versions** in the chat to view them
- **Restore** any previous version using the revert button

![Xnapper-2025-07-08-11.38.06.png](/images/Xnapper-2025-07-08-11.38.06.png)

Access your complete version history via the dropdown menu in the upper left or use `cmd + option + shift + h`


## Adding new elements

Expand your project through direct instructions to the builder:

- Chat with the builder about new requirements: "Create a new page for blog posts" or "Add user accounts for paid members"
- Use "/" commands to set up [Integrations](/builder/integrations) or upload assets


## Project settings

Configure important project-specific settings including assets, secret keys, custom instructions, generation settings, authentication providers, branding, social sharing, and mobile app settings.

### Available settings

- **Assets** - Upload images for repeated use in your project
- **Custom Instructions** - Shape builder interactions and project behavior (advanced feature)
- **Generation Settings** - Pro users can select their preferred LLM
- **Saved Secrets** - Store API keys for integrations
- **Providers** - Configure authentication options for user accounts
- **Branding and Icons** - Mobile app resources (coming soon)
- **Social Share** - Configure titles and descriptions for search engines and social media

<Warning>
  Certain custom instructions can prevent the builder from functioning correctly if they conflict with default behavior.
</Warning>

## Publishing your application

<Tip>
  You can view edits in demo mode or preview without publishing. Only publish when ready to share with external parties or go live.
</Tip>

When ready to launch, click the **Publish** button in the top right. Learn more about [Publishing](/publish-and-share/publish).
