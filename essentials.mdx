## Getting started

You chat with Create to build your app. Tell it what to build using **text** or **images** (paste them in).

Speed up with keyboard shortcuts:

- Press `cmd-enter` (or `ctrl-enter` on Windows) to send messages
- Use `/` **commands** to add [Integrations](/builder/integrations) or create new elements

Create projects can contain multiple elements to build end to end apps:

- [**Pages**](/builder/pages) for your app's screens
- [**Components**](/builder/components) for reusable UI pieces
- [**Functions**](/builder/functions) for backend logic and external API calls
- [**Databases**](/builder/databases) to store information
- [**User Accounts**](/builder/user-accounts) for authentication and users
- and more

When you start a new project, you begin on a single page.

<Tip>
  Don't want to start from scratch? Try a [**Template**](https://www.create.xyz/templates). Create's assistant will walk you through customizing the elements of the app.
</Tip>

## Making improvements

Iterate on your app by sending more messages to the assistant. Create updates your app based on your instructions and the current state of the project.

- Be specific and succinct 
- Callout defined areas to the builder if you want specific edits to a certain element or page
- Review our [prompting guide](/prompting) 

## Generations

When you send a message, Create uses your message, message history, and the app's code history to generate the code for a new version.

When generating, you'll see the **code stream** or a **building icon**. When it's done, you can play with the app in **Demo mode**.

<Tip>
  [Pro members](https://create.xyz/pricing) get better generations - Create uses more history and context to make smarter changes.
</Tip>

<Tip>
  Read our [guide to prompting](/prompting) to learn how to write clear messages that get the results you want.
</Tip>

## Version history

As you chat with Create, it saves your version history automatically.

You can:

- Tap on **previous versions** in the chat to view them
- **Restore** any previous version as the current version use the revert button

## View Modes: Demo, Code, and Dev Server

You can quickly switch between different modes to work on your app. Learn more about [controls](/builder/controls):

- **Demo mode**: the default view, work and test your application while building it
- **Code mode**: View and edit the underlying code
- **Dev Server**: A temporary sandbox to preview your site as a public user and test functions, authentication, payment systems and more.
