## Getting started

Build your application by conversing with Create. Describe your requirements using **text** or **images** (paste them directly into the chat).

### Keyboard shortcuts

Speed up your workflow with these shortcuts:

- Press `cmd-enter` (or `ctrl-enter` on Windows) to send messages
- Use `/` **commands** to add [Integrations](/builder/integrations) or create new elements

### Project components

Create projects can contain multiple elements to build end-to-end applications:

- [**Pages**](/builder/pages) - Application screens and user interfaces
- [**Components**](/builder/components) - Reusable UI elements
- [**Functions**](/builder/functions) - Backend logic and external API calls
- [**Databases**](/builder/databases) - Data storage and persistence
- [**User Accounts**](/builder/user-accounts) - Authentication and user management
- **Assets** - Images, logos, and media files

New projects begin with a single page that you can expand upon.

## Iterating and improving

Enhance your application by sending instructional messages to the assistant. Create updates your application based on your input and the current project state.

### Best practices

- Be specific and concise in your instructions
- Reference specific elements or pages for targeted edits
- Review our [prompting guide](/prompting) for optimal results

## Navigating your application

- Use the top-level navigation to switch between pages
- Features and pages are automatically added as you build
- Completion notifications appear in the chat
- Preview functionality may require navigation to specific areas or sample user login

## Discussion mode

Enable discussion mode to receive input, feedback, and best practices directly from the AI.

<Warning>
  Discussion mode intentionally prevents the builder from making changes to your project
</Warning>

![Discussion Pn](/images/discussion.png)

### Use cases

- Ask questions and receive suggestions from the builder
- Inquire about functionality or mobile compatibility
- Disable discussion mode to execute edits and changes

## Deep thinking mode

Enabled by default to enhance the builder experience. The AI agent works beyond code translation to investigate, research, and access external resources like hosted documentation.

### Example queries

- "How can I make this site more appealing to investors in X space?"
- "What key features am I missing?"
- "I want to integrate with the API at [place] using this documentation [link] to build a function for user data"

## Code generation

When you send a message, Create uses your input, message history, and application code history to generate new versions.

During generation, you'll see a **code stream** or **building icon**. Once complete, test your application in **Preview or Demo Mode.**

<Tip>
  [Pro members](https://create.xyz/pricing) receive enhanced generations with more context and history for smarter changes.

  Read our [prompting guide](/prompting) to learn effective communication techniques.
</Tip>

## Version history

Create automatically saves your version history as you build.

### Version management

- Tap **previous versions** in the chat to view them
- **Restore** any previous version using the revert button

![Xnapper-2025-07-08-11.38.06.png](/images/Xnapper-2025-07-08-11.38.06.png)

Access your complete version history via the dropdown menu in the upper left or use `cmd + option + shift + h`

## View modes

Switch between different modes to work on your application. Learn more about [controls](/builder/controls):

- **Demo mode** - Default view for building and testing your application
- **Code mode** - View and edit the underlying code
- **Preview** - Live sandbox to test your site as a public user, including functions, authentication, and payment systems

## Adding new elements

Expand your project through direct instructions to the builder:

- Chat with the builder about new requirements: "Create a new page for blog posts" or "Add user accounts for paid members"
- Use "/" commands to set up [Integrations](/builder/integrations) or upload assets

## Stopping generation

- Click the stop icon in the builder chat to halt unwanted changes or cancel requests

![Stop Pn](/images/stop.png)

## Refreshing preview

If changes aren't appearing, use the refresh button in the upper toolbar to update demo mode.
