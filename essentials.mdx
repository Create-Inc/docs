## What you can build

Anything generates complete applications from natural language descriptions. Build web apps, mobile apps, and full-stack systems with databases, authentication, and integrations.

</Frame>

### Core capabilities

- **Full-stack applications** - [Frontend](/builder/pages), [backend](/builder/functions), and [databases](/builder/databases) in one project
- **Real-time collaboration** - [Multiple users can build simultaneously](/publish-and-share/teams)
- **Mobile and web apps** - Publish to [app stores](/builder/mobile) and [web platforms](/publish-and-share/publish)
- **AI-powered development** - [Multiple agents](/Modes) available to help build and repair your app
- **Third-party integrations** - Connect to [APIs](/quick-tips/external-apis), services, and [external tools](/builder/integrations)

## Getting started

Describe your application in natural language. Anything understands requirements, generates code, and builds your project in real-time.

1. **Describe your app** - "Build a task management app with user authentication"
2. **Iterate with feedback** - "Add a calendar view" or "Make the design more modern"
3. **[Test](/builder/mobile/testing) and deploy** - [Preview](/Modes#demo-code-and-preview) your app and publish when ready

### Keyboard shortcuts

- `cmd-enter` (or `ctrl-enter`) - Send messages
- `/` - Access commands for [integrations](/builder/integrations) and new elements
- `cmd + option + shift + h` - View version history

## Project architecture

Anything projects contain all the components needed for production applications:

- [**Pages**](/builder/pages) - Application screens and user interfaces
- [**Components**](/builder/components) - Reusable UI elements and design systems
- [**Functions**](/builder/functions) - Backend logic, API endpoints, and external connections
- [**Databases**](/builder/databases) - Data storage, relationships, and queries
- [**User Accounts**](/builder/user-accounts) - Authentication, authorization, and user management
- **Assets** - Images, media files, and brand resources


## Advanced features

### AI modes

Choose the right AI for your task:

- **[Auto](/Modes)** - Intelligently selects the best model for your needs
- **[Thinking Mode](/Modes#thinking-mode)** - Deep reasoning for complex code work
- **[Discussion Mode](/Modes#discussion-mode)** - Planning and problem-solving
- **[Max](/builder/max)** - Autonomous software engineer that builds and fixes applications

### Project expansion

Add new features through natural conversation:

- **New pages** - "Create an admin dashboard with user management"
- **[Integrations](/builder/integrations)** - "Connect to [Stripe](/payments) for payments" or "Add email notifications"
- **Advanced features** - "Implement real-time chat" or "Add file uploads"

## Project Settings

To access Project Settings click on the Anything logo in the upper left of your project builder

![Project Navigation](/images/projectnavigation2.gif)

- **Assets** - Upload images and media for repeated use
- **Saved Secrets** - Store API keys and credentials securely
- **Authentication Providers** - Configure user login and social auth
- **Generation Settings** - Select your preferred AI model (Pro feature)
- **Custom Instructions** - Shape how the builder interacts with your project
- **Social Share** - Configure SEO and social media metadata

<Warning>
  Custom instructions can affect builder functionality if they conflict with default behavior.
</Warning>

## Best practices

### [Effective prompting](/prompting)

- **Be specific** - "Add a blue submit button" vs "make it better"
- **Reference elements** - "Update the header component to include navigation"
- **Iterate incrementally** - Build features step by step for better results
- **[Triage issues](/support/help#how-to-triage)** - Learn systematic approaches to debug problems

### Credit optimization

- **Use [Discussion Mode](/Modes#discussion-mode)** for planning complex features before building
- **[Test](/builder/mobile/testing) frequently** - [Preview](/Modes#demo-code-and-preview) changes before moving to the next feature
- **Leverage [Max](/builder/max)** for autonomous development and bug fixes
- **Review [credit usage](/account/credits)** to optimize your generation costs

## Publishing and deployment

<Tip>
  [Preview](/Modes#demo-code-and-preview) and [test](/builder/mobile/testing) your application before publishing. Only publish when ready for production use.
</Tip>

When ready to launch, click **Publish** in the top right. Your application can be deployed as a web app or packaged for mobile app stores.
