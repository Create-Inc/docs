## Getting started

You chat with Create to build your app. Tell it what to build using **text** or **images** (paste them in).

Speed up with keyboard shortcuts:

- Press `cmd-enter` (or `ctrl-enter` on Windows) to send messages
- Use `/` **commands** to add [Integrations](/builder/integrations) or create new elements

Create projects can contain multiple elements to build end to end apps:

- [**Pages**](/builder/pages) for your app's screens
- [**Components**](/builder/components) for reusable UI pieces
- [**Functions**](/builder/functions) for backend logic and external API calls
- [**Databases**](/builder/databases) to store information
- [**User Accounts**](/builder/user-accounts) for authentication and users
- and more

When you start a new project, you begin on a single page.

<Tip>
  Don't want to start from scratch? Try a [**Template**](https://www.create.xyz/templates). Create's assistant will walk you through customizing the elements of the app.
</Tip>

## Making improvements

Iterate on your app by sending more messages to the assistant. Create updates your app based on your instructions and the current state of the project.

You can change what level of detail you want to work on:

- When you select a **specific element**, messages update only that element
- When you select the **canvas**, messages can modify multiple elements at once

## Generations

When you send a message, Create uses your message, message history, and the app's code history to generate the code for a new version.

When generating, you'll see the **code stream** or a **building icon**. When it's done, you can play with the app in **Demo mode**.

<Tip>
  [Pro members](https://create.xyz/pricing) get better generations - Create uses more history and context to make smarter changes.
</Tip>

<Tip>
  Read our [guide to prompting](/prompting) to learn how to write clear messages that get the results you want.
</Tip>

### Project-wide vs Single Element

You can generate changes at two levels:

**Project-wide generation**

- Tap the **project name** in [**Project Selector**](/builder/controls#project-selector) or tap on **canvas**
- Messages apply to entire project
- Create can edit across multiple elements
- Create can add new [**Pages**](/builder/pages), [**Components**](/builder/components), [**Functions**](/builder/functions)
- Good for:
  - Building many elements quickly
  - Maintaining consistent styles
  - Features that span elements (**navigation**, [**databases**](/builder/databases))

**Single element generation**

- Tap **element name** in [**Project Selector**](/builder/controls#project-selector) or **select element** on canvas
- Messages only update that specific element
- Changes confined to selected [**Page**](/builder/pages), [**Component**](/builder/components), or [**Function**](/builder/functions)
- Good for:
  - Making targeted changes with more control
  - Refining specific features
  - Debugging

<Tip>
  Switch between **project** and **element** level as needed. Start broad with project-wide changes, then drill down to specific elements for fine-tuning.
</Tip>

## Version history

As you chat with Create, it saves your version history automatically.

You can:

- Tap on **previous versions** in the chat to view them
- **Restore** any previous version as the current version use the revert button

View your complete version history with the dropdown menu from the upper left of your dashboard or access it via cmd \+ option \+ shift \+ h

## View Modes: Demo, Code, and Dev Server

You can quickly switch between different modes to work on your app. Learn more about [controls](/builder/controls):

- **Demo mode**: the default view, work and test your application while building it
- **Code mode**: View and edit the underlying code
- **Dev Server**: A temporary sandbox to preview your site as a public user and test functions, authentication, payment systems and more.

## Creating new Elements

Add new elements to your project through:

- Tapping the [**Logo Menu**](/builder/controls#logo-menu) in the top left. From here make new [Pages](/builder/pages), [Components](/builder/components), [Functions](/builder/functions).
- `/` **commands** in the chat. See our guide on [integrations](/builder/integrations)

# Project Settings

Control important project specific settings including assets, secret keys, custom instructions, generation settings, authentication providers, branding, social share, mobile app settings and more.

- Assets - upload images to reference and use in your project repeatedly
- Custom Instructions - shape the way the builder interacts with you and your project. This is an advanced feature not generally required for daily use. See community examples of Custom Instructions [here. ](https://www.create.xyz/custom-instructions)
- Generation Settings - Pro users can decide which LLM they would like to have their builder use
- Saved Secrets - API keys stored in the project for integrations
- Providers - Authentication options for user account features, [more info here.](/builder/user-accounts)
- Branding and Icons - mobile app specific resources (more coming soon)
- Social Share - Choose a title and description that appears in search engine results and on social media when shared

## Go Live

When you're ready to launch your app, tap the **Publish** button in the top right. Learn more about [Publishing](/publish-and-share/publish).
