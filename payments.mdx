</Note>

## Overview

Create's Stripe v2 integration makes it easy to add payments to your app without technical setup. Simply connect your Stripe account and tell the agent what you want.

## Quick Start

### 1. Connect Your Stripe Account

1. Go to your Create dashboard
2. Click **Accept Payments**
3. Click **Connect with Stripe**
4. Follow the setup process
5. Ensure you have created a Product or Products in Stripe
6. You're ready to accept payments!

### 2. Add Payments to Your App

Tell the agent what you want using simple language:

**For subscriptions:**
- "Add a $9.99/month subscription to my app"
- "Create a yearly plan for $99/year"

**For one-time payments:**
- "Add a one-time payment option for premium features"
- "Create a tip jar where users can pay what they want"

**For custom pricing:**
- "Set up different pricing tiers: Basic ($5), Pro ($15), Enterprise ($50)"

### 3. The Agent Builds Everything

The agent will automatically create:
- Payment pages
- Checkout functionality
- Database updates
- Error handling

## What Gets Created

When you ask for payments, the agent typically builds:

### Payment Pages
- **Subscription page**: Where users sign up for recurring payments
- **Checkout page**: Where users complete their purchase
- **Account page**: Where users manage their subscription

### Backend Functions
- **Create checkout**: Starts the payment process
- **Check payment status**: Confirms when payments complete
- **Update database**: Records successful payments

## Common Use Cases

### Subscription App
```
"Add a $9.99/month subscription to my app with a 7-day free trial"
```

**What you get:**
- Users can subscribe with a free trial
- Automatic billing after trial ends
- Users can cancel anytime

### One-Time Purchase
```
"Add a one-time payment of $29 for premium features"
```

**What you get:**
- Users pay once for lifetime access
- Immediate access after payment
- No recurring charges

### Multiple Pricing Tiers
```
"Create three pricing tiers: Basic ($5/month), Pro ($15/month), Enterprise ($50/month)"
```

**What you get:**
- Users can choose their plan
- Different features per tier
- Easy upgrade/downgrade options

## Best Practices

### Before Going Live
1. **Test everything** - Create by default puts your Stripe instance in Test Mode while building so you can immediately input faux credit card numbers to attempt purchases
2. **Verify payment flow** works end-to-end
3. **Check error handling** for failed payments
4. **Test user experience** from start to finish

### User Experience
- **Clear pricing**: Show exactly what users get
- **Simple checkout**: Minimize steps to complete payment
- **Clear feedback**: Show payment status and confirmations
- **Easy cancellation**: Make it simple to cancel subscriptions

### Monitoring
- **Check Stripe dashboard** regularly
- **Monitor failed payments**
- **Track subscription status**
- **Watch for error messages**
