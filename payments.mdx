## Overview

Create's built-in Stripe integration lets you easily add payments to your app without complex setup. You can collect payments for:

- Monthly subscriptions (like $20/month for Pro access)
- One-time purchases (like $100 for lifetime access)
- Multiple pricing tiers (Basic, Pro, Enterprise)
- B2B invoicing (for custom work or consulting)

## Setup

<Steps>
  <Step title="Connect Stripe Account">
    Complete your Stripe onboarding in your Create dashboard. This links your app to your Stripe account so you can receive payments.

    </Frame>
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Enable Authentication">
    You'll want users to sign in so you can track who has paid for what.
    ```
    "Allow users to login so we can track free vs paid customers"
    ```
  </Step>
    <Step title="Update the builder with your desired pricing model or pricing system">
    ```
    "Setup a Pro plan, allow them to create 50 to-do tasks after paying 19.99 a month in Stripe, keep free users at 10."
    ```
  </Step>
</Steps>
