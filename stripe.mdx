title: "Stripe Subscriptions (Beta)"
description: "Set up subscription payments for your app"
---

<Note>
  This is a beta feature. We're improving it before general release. For now, it requires manual set up. Contact dhruv@create.xyz or join our Discord (create.xyz/discord) for help.
</Note>

Stripe lets you set up payments for your app so you can charge users for access or features.

Our new integration helps set it up in minutes. It lets you:

- Create a payment account in Create with Stripe
- Add key Stripe functions + components to your app for building payment and checkout flows
- Lets users subscribe to your app 
- Track which users have subscribed in your user accounts database
- Unlock app features based on the user's subscription status

<Note>
  This integration is designed for Stripe subscriptions (users pay $X per month for a paid tier, similar to Create Pro).

  Other payment methods (like one-time or tips) are not officially supported yet. You can customize the Stripe elements the integration adds.  
</Note>


## Prerequisites

<Check>
  A Create project with User Accounts enabled
</Check>

## User Flow

Here's what your user flow will look like once set up:

1. User visits your landing page
2. User signs in with User Accounts
3. User sees:
   - Free tier app with your paid upgrade upsell OR
   - Upsell required from start for access
4. User goes through upsell to buy a subscription:
   - Redirected to Stripe checkout
   - Fills in payment details in Stripe's UI
5. User submits payment:
   - Redirected to your app after subscribing
   - User marked as active subscriber in your user accounts database
   - Gains access to paid features
6. User later cancels subscription:
   - User marked as inactive subscriber in your user accounts database
   - Access to paid features removed

After a customer subscribes, you can manage them manually from your Stripe dashboard.

## Make a Stripe Account

<Steps>
  <Step title="Visit Create Dashboard -> Accept Payments">
    <img src="/images/stripe/connect/create-accept-payments.png" alt="Accept Payments" />
  </Step>
  <Step title="Complete Stripe Onboarding">
    Create partners with Stripe to securely store your business information.

    Hit 'Add information' to start. A Stripe popup will appear asking for email/password.

    <Note>
      Have a Stripe account already? Use that email to reuse your business info and save time.
    </Note>

    Follow these steps to complete Stripe's secure onboarding:

    1. Account
       - Enter your email
       - Create a Stripe password

    2. Personal information  
       - Full legal name
       - Date of birth 
       - Phone number
       - Home address

    3. Business details
       - Business name and type
       - Business address
       - Industry and website

    4. Tax Information
       - SSN or EIN
       - Tax ID verification

    5. Bank Account (for payouts)
       - Account number
       - Routing number
       - Bank verification
  </Step>

  <Step title="Verify Email">
    Check your inbox for a verification email from Stripe and click the link to verify your email.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Confirm Stripe Dashboard Access">
    Once you've verified your email, you'll see your business information and a "View Stripe Dashboard" button in the 'Accept Payments' section of the dashboard.

    Your Stripe dashboard is used to manually make changes to your subscription products, prices, customers. You'll copy keys (STRIPE_PRICE_ID and STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET) from here to Create.   

    <Tip>
      We're working on automated updates from Create to your connected Stripe account when you make a request to the assistant. 
      
      For now, you'll need to return to the Stripe dashboard to make manual changes to your products, prices, and customers when you make changes in your Create app.
    </Tip>
  </Step>

</Steps>

## Add Stripe to Your Project

<Note>
  Before you start, make sure you have:
  - A Create project where you want to add subscriptions
  - User Accounts enabled in the project ([learn how](/builder/user-accounts))
</Note>


You're going to do a few things:

- Use our integration to add the checkout elements (functions + components) you need
- Set up the product, price, and webhook in your Stripe account in Test Mode
- Add keys from your Stripe account to the added functions in Create 
- Customize look & feel of the added components in Create
- Prompt Create to add the components to the right places in your app
- Publish your app
- Test your app flow in the published app

Once it all looks good:

- Repeat the Stripe set up steps in Live Mode
- Copy new keys to Create
- Publish again + launch your app

  <Step title="Go to Project" />

  <Step title="Press / in the chat" />

  <Step title="Select 'Stripe - Subscriptions'">
    Prompt "Add Stripe - Subscriptions to this project. [other details of your subscription]"
  </Step>

  <Step title="Send message">
    Create will automatically add the integration elements to your project
  </Step>

    <img src="/images/stripe/connect/elements-copied.png" style={{ borderRadius: '0.5rem' }} />
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Added Stripe Elements

When you use the integration, Create adds 4 elements to your project to help build checkout flows & track user status. 

#### Stripe Checkout Link
This function generates stripe checkout URL for your product/subscription
- Redirects users to Stripe's hosted checkout page
- Needs the STRIPE_PRICE_ID as a secret key from your Stripe account

You won't need to modify this besides adding your STRIPE_PRICE_ID. 

<Tip>
  Learn how to get your STRIPE_PRICE_ID [here](#make-product-price-and-get-stripe_price_id) section below.
</Tip>

#### Subscription Upsell

This component gives you an upsell UI that will redirect users to Stripe to checkout. Customizable as button or link, with built-in Stripe Checkout Link integration.

- Customize its look and feel
- Add to the right places in your app
- Redirects the user to Stripe with Stripe Checkout Link function when the user taps "subscribe"

You can style this component and add it to the right places in your app.

#### Stripe Webhook

This function listens for successful payments and subscription updates.
It logs the user's subscription status in your user accounts users database.  

- Automatically updates user payment status
- Manages subscription lifecycle in your database
- Needs the STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET as a secret key from your Stripe account

You won't need to modify this besides adding your STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET as a secret. 

<Tip>
  Learn how to get your STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET [here](#add-stripe-webhook-and-stripe_webhook_secret) section below.
</Tip>

#### Check Subscription Wrapper

Component for gating premium content based on the user's subscription status.

- Shows/hides content based on subscription status
- Checks subscription status for current user in your users database
- If the user isn't subscribed, it shows the Subscription Upsell 

You can use this component when describing things you only want paid users to see, and Create will include to gate content. 

Prompt examples 

```
Use /[Check Subscription Wrapper] to hide the generations remaining counter for users that are subscribed"
```

```
If the user is subscribed, show the extra content for pro members using /[Check Subscription Wrapper]"
```

### Set up your Stripe product 

You'll make a product and price in Stripe for your subscription. You'll copy the STRIPE_PRICE_ID from Stripe to use in your Create app.   

<Note>
  Start by setting up your integration in Stripe's Test Mode.

  This lets you verify everything works without real transactions. Once tested, turn Test Mode off and repeat these steps with your live credentials.
</Note>

#### Understanding Test Mode

Stripe's Test Mode lets you make test versions of your products/prices. You can simulate payments without charging real cards.

<img src="/images/stripe/connect/test-mode.png" style={{ borderRadius: '0.5rem' }} />

- Enable Test Mode in Stripe dashboard (switch in top-right) 
- All products and subscriptions created are test versions
- API keys and webhooks apply to test mode only
- Payments are simulated, not real charges
- Switch to production by turning Test Mode off and repeating all setup steps

<Warning>
  Always test your integration in Test Mode before going live. When you want to go live, turn Test Mode off and repeat all set up steps with your production credentials.
</Warning>

#### Add Stripe Webhook and get STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET

<Steps>
  <Step title="Go to Create project">
    Navigate to your Create project
  </Step>

  <Step title="Copy the project id from the URL in the builder">
    
    <img src="/images/build-link.png" style={{ borderRadius: '0.5rem' }} />
    
    <Tip>
      Example URL: https://www.create.xyz/build/326163b8-7363-489e-9def-13d8717f6ce6?view=9b95002f-0f1c-4c60-bf98-18a61e7a52cb&select=9b95002f-0f1c-4c60-bf98-18a61e7a52cb

      The project ID is between `/build/` and the `?`: `326163b8-7363-489e-9def-13d8717f6ce6`
    </Tip>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Create webhook URL">
    You'll now make a webhook URL for it in this format: `<project-groupid>.created.app/api/stripe-webhook`

    So the final URL here is: `326163b8-7363-489e-9def-13d8717f6ce6.created.app/api/stripe-webhook`
  </Step>

  <Step title="Access Stripe Dashboard">

  </Step>

  <Step title="Add Secret">
    Add STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET as the name. For the value, paste in the secret you copied from Stripe.
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Hooking Up the Elements to Your App

You now can build your flows. 

<Steps>
  <Step title="Add Subscription Upsell">
    Add the Subscription Upsell component where you want the subscribe button
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Use the Check Subscription Wrapper to gate features">
    Prompt Create to use this component when you want to control access to features based on the user's subscription status.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Publish your app">
    When you publish, be sure to toggle your Stripe Checkout Link function & Stripe Webhook function to on.
  
    Do not change the function routes. They should be `/api/stripe-checkout-link` and `/api/stripe-webhook` to have your components and webhooks work. 
  
    <img src="/images/stripe/connect/publish-functions.png" style={{ borderRadius: '0.5rem' }} />
  </Step>

  <Step title="Test your app">
    Run through your flow in your published app. 

    1. Verify when you hit subscribe, you're redirected to Stripe
    2. If you've put in the keys in Test Mode, you'll see Test Mode in the Stripe checkout page

    <Tip>
      In Test Mode, your card won't be charged for real. You can use Stripe's test card numbers:
      - Card number: 4242 4242 4242 4242
      - Any future expiration date
      - Any 3-digit CVC
      - Any postal code
      
      This test card will always succeed. For other test scenarios (declined, errors etc), see [Stripe's test cards documentation](https://stripe.com/docs/testing#cards).
    </Tip>

    3. After paying, you should be redirected back to your app. 
    4. Check in your users database to see that the signed in user is marked as subscribed
    5. After the user is subscribed, make sure the right content is shown to them.   

  </Step>
</Steps>

### Going Live 

When you're ready to go live, turn Test Mode off and repeat the Stripe set up steps:

- Replicate your product and price
- Make a new webhook in Stripe

Replace the keys (STRIPE_PRICE_ID and STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET) with the versions when Test Mode is off.

Publish your app again and launch it
