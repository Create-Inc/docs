## **Best Practices**

- During app development you may run into errors or functionality that is not performing to your specifications
- You can feed errors back to the builder directly such as “Homepage showing empty image upon page load” or “user login feature is not allowing password reset.” Be specific, ensure you follow our [**prompting guide**](https://www.create.xyz/docs/prompting) for best results
- Revert/Restore - use our [**Version History**](https://www.create.xyz/docs/essentials#version-history) feature to step backward to remove an edit or feature that is causing issues
- Test your functions - if you are having an issue with a function, such as a database write, go to the function and [**run a test**](https://www.create.xyz/docs/builder/functions#testing-functions).
- Publish and test your app often
