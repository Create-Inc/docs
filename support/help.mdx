## Status Page

If there is an outage or system wide issue we will report it on our status page available at [status.create.xyz](http://status.create.xyz)

Anything's AI Agent relies on upstream data from Anthropic's Claude Sonnet AI Model, if there is an outage with their system it will impact our builder's ability to execute commands. You can view their status page [here.](https://status.anthropic.com/)

## Support

Our primary support channel is over email, [hello@create.xyz](mailto:hello@create.xyz). Please reach out with questions or to report issues with your build. Please consider including your build URL to help us expedite any investigation. Thank you\!

### Sharing Your Build

When asking for help, please include:

1. A link to your `/build` page for the project you're working on
2. A specific description of what's not working (e.g., "The function called "RetrieveWeather" returns a 500 error when submitting the form")

Build links help us see your generated code and troubleshoot more effectively.

<Note>
  Your build links are private - even if shared publicly, only team members can access them. Anything team members and admins can jump into your build to help you out (with your permission).
