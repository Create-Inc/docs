### Best Approaches for Self-Debugging

<Steps>
  <Step>
    <h5>Identify the Issue</h5>
    <p>Open your application and clearly identify what's not working. For mobile apps, test on your device using Expo Go to reproduce errors accurately. <strong>Focus on one issue at a time for best results.</strong></p>
  </Step>
  <Step>
    <h5>Capture Error Details</h5>
    <p>Copy the error message from your logs (use the copy button at the bottom of error logs) and note the specific behavior or feature that's broken.</p>
  </Step>
  <Step>
    <h5>Use Discussion Mode to Plan</h5>
    <p>Switch to Discussion Mode and paste the error. The AI will analyze the issue and provide you with an ideal prompt to fix it. Copy this prompt for the next step. <strong>Watch the video above for detailed guidance on this process.</strong></p>
  </Step>
  <Step>
    <h5>Execute in Thinking Mode</h5>
    <p>Toggle back to Thinking Mode and paste the prompt from Discussion Mode. The AI will execute the fix automatically. Allow time for testing and verification.</p>
  </Step>
  <Step>
    <h5>Verify and Test</h5>
    <p>Refresh your preview after the process completes, then test the previously broken functionality to confirm the fix worked.</p>
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Note>
  Watch the video above for detailed guidance on using Discussion Mode for debugging. Work through one error at a time for best results.

## Version History Restore

If you need to revert to a previous version of your project, you can use the Version History feature to restore from an earlier point directly in the chat.

<Steps>
  <Step>
    <h5>Choose Your Method</h5>
    <p>You have two options: restore directly from the builder chat (as shown in the screenshot above) or open your project settings menu to find the version history viewer.</p>
  </Step>
  <Step>
    <h5>Select Previous Version</h5>
    <p>Browse through your project's version history and identify the version you want to restore from.</p>
  </Step>
  <Step>
    <h5>Restore and Confirm</h5>
    <p>Click the restore option for your chosen version and confirm the action. This will revert your project to that previous state.</p>
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Note>
  Version History allows you to restore your project to any previous state. Use this feature when you need to undo recent changes or recover from unexpected issues.

## Status Page

If there is an outage or system wide issue we will report it on our status page available at [status.create.xyz](http://status.create.xyz)

Anything's AI Agent relies on upstream data from Anthropic's Claude Sonnet AI Model, if there is an outage with their system it will impact our builder's ability to execute commands. You can view their status page [here.](https://status.anthropic.com/)
