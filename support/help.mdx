## Triaging Issues and Code Errors

During app development you may run into errors or functionality that is not performing to your specifications. This is normal in development and we have features to support you.

<Note>
  Nearly every issue you may encounter with your project is directly fixable with prompting. Please consider reviewing our [prompting guide](https://www.create.xyz/docs/prompting) for best results
</Note>

- Use the error logs to feed specifics back to the builder. Remember, "doesn't work" is not a successful piece of feedback to anyone including the AI
- Feed errors or issues back to the builder directly as succinct prompts:

  ```
  Homepage showing empty image upon page load 
  ```

  ```
  When a user logs in they are taken to the homepage, they should be routed to user dashboard
  ```
- Revert/Restore - use our [Version History](https://www.create.xyz/docs/essentials#version-history) feature to step backward to remove an edit or feature that is causing issues
- If you aren't seeing a recent edit in the demo view of your project you can try a few things to remedy:
  - You can quickly [refresh](https://www.create.xyz/docs/essentials#refresh-your-preview) the demo page
  - If you've recently implemented [Custom Instructions](https://www.create.xyz/docs/essentials#project-settings) they can sometimes interfere with the builders ability to generate a completed task. Consider temporarily removing them to test.
  - Open the project in the [preview mode](https://www.create.xyz/docs/essentials#view-modes%3A-demo%2C-code%2C-and-preview) to see if your changes are reflected there

    If the builder reports an error completing your request, this can sometimes be due to temporary outages by data partners of Anything. For example, if [Anthropic reports an outage](https://status.anthropic.com/) it can impact our ability to execute commands until resolved.

## Connection Issues

If you experience connection issues attempting to reach [Create.xyz](http://Create.xyz) or see an error such as "this site can't provide a secure connection" or "create.xyz sent an invalid response" this is typically caused by security measures on your network (such as a corproate office wifi network.) Due to some bad actors who also have .xyz domains, there can be a general block for any domain with this domain extension. \
\
You can workaround this by using your own DNS settings, such as via [Cloudflare's Warp Extension](https://developers.cloudflare.com/warp-client/get-started/) or by having [Create.xyz](http://Create.xyz) whitelisted with your network team.

## Status Page

If there is an outage or system wide issue we will report it on our status page available at [status.create.xyz](http://status.create.xyz)

Anything's AI Agent relies on upstream data from Anthropic's Claude Sonnet AI Model, if there is an outage with their system it will impact our builder's ability to execute commands. You can view their status page [here.](https://status.anthropic.com/)

## Support

Our primary support channel is over email, [hello@create.xyz](mailto:hello@create.xyz). Please reach out with questions or to report issues with your build. Please consider including your build URL to help us expedite any investigation. Thank you\!

### Sharing Your Build

When asking for help, please include:

1. A link to your `/build` page for the project you're working on
2. A specific description of what's not working (e.g., "The function called "RetrieveWeather" returns a 500 error when submitting the form")

Build links help us see your generated code and troubleshoot more effectively.

<Note>
  Your build links are private - even if shared publicly, only team members can access them. Anything team members and admins can jump into your build to help you out (with your permission).
