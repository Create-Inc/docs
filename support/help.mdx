We're actively adding more guides. If you don't see something covered here, let us know and we'll add it. 

## Support

We run a Discord community for all Create users to get help from both the community and our team. For project-specific questions, post in the #help-me-build channel where our community members and team are ready to assist.

### Sharing Your Build

When asking for help, please include:

1. A link to your `/build` page for the project you're working on
2. A specific description of what's not working (e.g., "The function called "RetrieveWeather" returns a 500 error when submitting the form")

Build links help us see your generated code and troubleshoot more effectively.

<Note>
  Your build links are private - even if shared publicly, only team members can access them. Create team members and admins can jump into your build to help you out (with your permission).
</Note>
