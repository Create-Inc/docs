We're actively adding more guides. If you don't see something covered here, let us know and we'll add it.

## Triaging Issues and Code Errors

- During app development you may run into errors or functionality that is not performing to your specifications
- You can feed errors back to the builder directly "Homepage showing empty image upon page load" or "user login feature is not allowing password reset." Be specific, ensure you follow our [prompting guide](https://www.create.xyz/docs/prompting) for best results
- Revert/Restore - use our [Version History](https://www.create.xyz/docs/essentials#version-history) feature to step backward to remove an edit or feature that is causing issues
- Test your functions - if you are having an issue with a function, such as a database write, go to the function and [run a test](https://www.create.xyz/docs/builder/functions#testing-functions).

## Support

We run a Discord community for all Create users to get help from both the community and our team. For project-specific questions, post in the #help-me-build channel where our community members and team are ready to assist.

### Sharing Your Build

When asking for help, please include:

1. A link to your `/build` page for the project you're working on
2. A specific description of what's not working (e.g., "The function called "RetrieveWeather" returns a 500 error when submitting the form")

Build links help us see your generated code and troubleshoot more effectively.

<Note>
  Your build links are private - even if shared publicly, only team members can access them. Create team members and admins can jump into your build to help you out (with your permission).
