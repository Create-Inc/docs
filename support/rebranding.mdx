title: "Create is now Anything"
description: "Anything means direct to app store publishing and a whole lot more"

## What's Changed?
- 10x more powerful coding Agent with Reasoning
- Direct to app store publishing
- Build mobile apps and web apps
- Ready to scale with a native file system, designed from the groundup to support complex apps
- In stream error checking and autorecovery


### What This Means for You:

- ✅ **Same login credentials** - use the same email and password
- ✅ **Same pricing** - no changes to your subscription or billing
- ✅ **New projects trigger the new builder** - existing projects will remain on the legacy build, start a new project to experience the new system and make native mobile apps

### What about my existing projects before the changeover?

- Existing projects will remain on the legacy build and continue to be hosted as they are today. You do not need to do anything to keep them running.
- Existing projects will not be able to access the new builder or agent experience, for now that requires a new project.
- You can quickly spot a project that is on the legacy build by opening it and seeing the "Legacy" tag in the top right corner.
