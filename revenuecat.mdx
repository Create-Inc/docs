- Track subscription status and manage entitlements
- Create and test paywall templates
- Analyze revenue and manage customers
- Sync subscriptions across platforms

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have:

- An [App Store Connect](https://appstoreconnect.apple.com) account with an active developer program membership
- A [RevenueCat](https://www.revenuecat.com) account

## Setup

### Connect your accounts at the platform level

First, connect your accounts at the platform level to enable in-app purchases and subscriptions across all your projects.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Navigate to Settings">
    Go to **Dashboard > Settings > Accept Payments > Mobile**
    <Frame>
      <img src="/images/revcat.png" />
    </Frame>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Connect App Store Connect">
    Connect your App Store Developer account to enable in-app purchases and subscriptions.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Connect RevenueCat">
    Connect your RevenueCat account to manage subscriptions and track revenue.
    
    <Note>
      During RevenueCat onboarding, you may see code snippets or packages. Ignore these for now. Anything handles the integration automatically.
    </Note>
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Connect your accounts at the project level

After connecting at the platform level, connect your accounts at the project level.

In this step, you're connecting a specific Anything Mobile Project to its corresponding, matching project in RevenueCat and App Store Connect. If you don't yet have projects in those systems to link to, you can create them in this menu and link them.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Open your project">
    Navigate to the mobile app project where you want to add RevenueCat.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Navigate to project settings">
    In your project, go to **Project Settings > In app purchases** to connect to the matching projects in RevenueCat and App Store Connect.
    <Frame>
      <img src="/images/RCproject.png" />
    </Frame>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Connect App Store Connect">
    Connect to the matching project in App Store Connect, or create a new project if needed.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Connect RevenueCat">
    Connect to the matching project in RevenueCat, or create a new project if needed. This ensures you can control and track revenue for this project.
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Add RevenueCat to your project

<Steps>
  <Step title="Add the integration">
    Once your accounts are connected, in the chat, ask the agent to add RevenueCat integration:
    ```
    "Add RevenueCat + App Store Connect to this project"
    ```
  </Step>
  <Step title="Configure products">
    The agent helps you set up subscription tiers and products. You can define:
    - Subscription plans (monthly, yearly, etc.)
    - One-time purchases
    - Entitlements that unlock features in your app
  </Step>
</Steps>

## How it works

RevenueCat integrates automatically with your mobile app. Here's how the payment flow works:

1. **Configure products** in both App Store Connect and RevenueCat
2. **Users make purchases** through Apple's in-app purchase system (they see Apple's payment UI)
3. **Apple processes the payment** and takes their commission (typically 15-30%)
4. **RevenueCat receives the purchase event** from Apple and tracks subscription status
5. **RevenueCat unlocks features** in your app based on entitlements
6. **You receive payouts** from Apple (not RevenueCat) according to Apple's payout schedule

RevenueCat manages subscriptions and entitlements. Apple processes payments. No code is required. Everything is handled through prompts and configuration.

## Testing

### Testing in the Anything iOS App

You can test your RevenueCat integration directly in the [Anything iOS App](/builder/anything-ios) on your device. This allows you to:

- Test purchases and subscriptions in Apple's sandbox environment
- Validate paywall functionality before going live
- Test subscription states and payment flows
- Preview your app natively on your device

To test RevenueCat in the Anything iOS App:

1. **Install the Anything iOS App** - Download from the [App Store](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/anything-ai-app-builder/id6751247034) and sign in with your Anything account
2. **Open your project** - Your projects sync automatically between devices
3. **Test natively** - Preview and test your app directly on your device with full native functionality

For detailed instructions on testing mobile apps, see [Testing & Debugging Mobile Apps](/builder/mobile/testing). When you're ready to publish to the App Store, see [Publishing to iOS App Store](/builder/mobile/publishing-ios) for instructions on submitting your app to App Store Connect.

### Production

Once your app is approved and released:

- Real payment processing through Apple's App Store
- Automatic App Store compliance
- Live analytics and customer management in your RevenueCat dashboard
