## Overview

Want to monetize your app? RevenueCat makes it simple to add subscriptions and in-app purchases to your iOS app without complex payment code.

Instead of wrestling with Apple's in-app purchase APIs or building your own payment infrastructure, RevenueCat handles subscription management, entitlements, and revenue tracking. You focus on building features; RevenueCat handles monetization.

Here's what you get:

- **Set up monetization quickly** - Configure subscriptions, one-time purchases, and premium features without writing payment code
- **Track revenue and growth** - Monitor revenue, analyze customer behavior, and understand what's driving your business
- **Test and optimize** - Build paywalls, A/B test pricing, and optimize your revenue strategy with real data

Apple processes all payments, but RevenueCat gives you the tools and insights to grow your app's revenue effectively.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have:

- An [iOS mobile app project in Anything](/builder/mobile)
- **[An active Apple Developer Account](/builder/mobile/verify-apple-developer-account)** - Required to publish apps and use in-app purchases. Provides access to [App Store Connect](https://appstoreconnect.apple.com).
- A [RevenueCat](https://www.revenuecat.com) account

<Warning>
  How to verify your Apple Developer Account is Active? [Review this article](/builder/mobile/verify-apple-developer-account).

## Setup

### Connect your accounts at the platform level

First, connect your accounts at the platform level to enable in-app purchases and subscriptions across all your projects.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Navigate to Settings">
    Go to **Dashboard > Settings > Accept Payments > Mobile**
    <Frame>
      <img src="/images/revcat.png" />
    </Frame>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Connect App Store Connect">
    Connect your App Store Developer account to enable in-app purchases and subscriptions.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Connect RevenueCat">
    Connect your RevenueCat account to manage subscriptions and track revenue.
    
    <Note>
      During RevenueCat onboarding, you may see code snippets or packages. Ignore these for now. Anything handles the integration automatically.
    </Note>
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Add RevenueCat to your project

After connecting at the platform level, add RevenueCat to your project using the AI agent.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Open your project">
    Navigate to the mobile app project where you want to add RevenueCat.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Set up RevenueCat">
    In the chat, ask the agent to set up RevenueCat:
    ```
    "Add RevenueCat + App Store Connect to this project"
    ```
    The AI builder will automatically connect your project to matching projects in RevenueCat and App Store Connect, or create new ones if needed.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Configure products">
    The agent helps you set up subscription tiers and products. You can define:
    - Subscription plans (monthly, yearly, etc.)
    - One-time purchases
    - Entitlements that unlock features in your app
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Note>
  **Reviewing connections (optional)**: You can review the connections the AI builder made by going to **Project Settings > In app purchases**. This shows the connected projects in RevenueCat and App Store Connect, but you don't need to manually configure these—the AI handles it automatically.
</Note>

## How it works

RevenueCat integrates automatically with your mobile app. Here's how the payment flow works:

1. **Configure products** using the AI agent in Anything. For example: `"Create a Pro Level Subscription that is 9.99 USD a month"`
2. **Users make purchases** through Apple's in-app purchase system (they see Apple's payment UI)
3. **Apple processes the payment** and takes their commission (typically 15-30%)
4. **RevenueCat receives the purchase event** from Apple and tracks subscription status
5. **RevenueCat unlocks features** in your app based on entitlements
6. **You receive payouts** from Apple (not RevenueCat) according to Apple's payout schedule

RevenueCat manages subscriptions and entitlements. Apple processes payments. No code is required. Everything is handled through prompts and configuration with the AI agent.

## Testing

### Testing in the Anything iOS App

You can test your RevenueCat integration directly in the [Anything iOS App](/builder/anything-ios) on your device. This allows you to:

- Test purchases and subscriptions in Apple's sandbox environment
- Validate paywall functionality before going live
- Test subscription states and payment flows
- Preview your app natively on your device

To test RevenueCat in the Anything iOS App:

1. **Install the Anything iOS App** - Download from the [App Store](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/anything-ai-app-builder/id6751247034) and sign in with your Anything account
2. **Open your project** - Your projects sync automatically between devices
3. **Test natively** - Preview and test your app directly on your device with full native functionality

For detailed instructions on testing mobile apps, see [Testing & Debugging Mobile Apps](/builder/mobile/testing). When you're ready to publish to the App Store, see [Publishing to iOS App Store](/builder/mobile/publishing-ios) for instructions on submitting your app to App Store Connect.

### Testing on TestFlight

Submit your app to Apple via our system to test in TestFlight. Test purchases work in TestFlight's production-like environment. See [Publishing to iOS App Store](/builder/mobile/publishing-ios) for submission instructions.

### Production

Once your app is approved and released:

- Real payment processing through Apple's App Store
- Automatic App Store compliance
- Live analytics and customer management in your RevenueCat dashboard
