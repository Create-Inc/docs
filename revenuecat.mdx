## Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have:

## Setup

### Connect your accounts globally

First, connect your accounts at the account level.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Navigate to Settings">
    Go to **Dashboard > Settings > Accept Payments > Mobile**
    <Frame>
      <img src="/images/revcat.png" />
    </Frame>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Connect App Store Connect">
    Connect your App Store Developer account to enable in-app purchases and subscriptions.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Connect RevenueCat">
    Connect your RevenueCat account to manage subscriptions and track revenue.
    
    <Note>
      During RevenueCat onboarding, you may see code snippets or packages. Ignore these for now. Anything handles the integration automatically.
    </Note>
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Connect your accounts per project

After connecting globally, connect your accounts for each individual project.

In this step, you're matching project to project, from our system to RevenueCat and App Store Connect. If you don't yet have projects in those systems to link to, you can create them in this menu and link them.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Open your project">
    Navigate to the mobile app project where you want to add RevenueCat.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Navigate to project settings">
    In your project, go to **Project Settings > In app purchases** to connect to the matching projects in RevenueCat and App Store Connect.
    <Frame>
      <img src="/images/RCproject.png" />
    </Frame>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Connect App Store Connect">
    Connect to the matching project in App Store Connect, or create a new project if needed.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Connect RevenueCat">
    Connect to the matching project in RevenueCat, or create a new project if needed. This ensures you can control and track revenue for this project.
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Add RevenueCat to your project

<Steps>
  <Step title="Add the integration">
    Once your accounts are connected, in the chat, ask the agent to add RevenueCat integration:
    ```
    "Add RevenueCat + App Store Connect to this project"
    ```
  </Step>
  <Step title="Configure products">
    The agent helps you set up subscription tiers and products. You can define:
    - Subscription plans (monthly, yearly, etc.)
    - One-time purchases
    - Entitlements that unlock features in your app
  </Step>
</Steps>

## How it works

RevenueCat integrates automatically with your mobile app. Here's how the payment flow works:

1. **Configure products** in both App Store Connect and RevenueCat
2. **Users make purchases** through Apple's in-app purchase system (they see Apple's payment UI)
3. **Apple processes the payment** and takes their commission (typically 15-30%)
4. **RevenueCat receives the purchase event** from Apple and tracks subscription status
5. **RevenueCat unlocks features** in your app based on entitlements
6. **You receive payouts** from Apple (not RevenueCat) according to Apple's payout schedule

RevenueCat manages subscriptions and entitlements. Apple processes payments. No code is required. Everything is handled through prompts and configuration.

## Testing

### TestFlight (sandbox testing)

Test your RevenueCat integration in [TestFlight](https://developer.apple.com/testflight/) before releasing to the App Store. TestFlight uses Apple's sandbox environment, which allows you to:

- Test purchases without real charges
- Simulate subscription states and payment flows
- Validate paywall functionality before going live
- Test on real devices with sandbox Apple ID accounts

<Note>
  In sandbox environments, subscription renewals occur every 24 hours (regardless of subscription duration) to speed up testing cycles.
</Note>

### Production

Once your app is approved and released:

- Real payment processing through Apple's App Store
- Automatic App Store compliance
- Live analytics and customer management in your RevenueCat dashboard
