## Overview

Components are reusable building blocks that Create automatically generates for your application. They help create consistent, maintainable interfaces by breaking down complex UIs into smaller, manageable pieces that work seamlessly together.

We use components to:

* Break down large projects into manageable pieces
* Maintain consistency across your application
* Save development time with reusable elements
* Improve code quality and reduce complexity
* Build a library of components for your team

As your application grows, Create automatically identifies opportunities to create components, helping reduce code complexity and improve maintainability.

## Chat-based component generation

Create automatically updates your component structure as you chat about your application.

When a feature requires reusable UI elements, it:

1. **Identifies reusable patterns** in your requests
2. **Creates Components** with appropriate structure and arguments
3. **Integrates Components** into your pages and other components
4. **Maintains consistency** across your entire application
