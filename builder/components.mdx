## Overview

Components are reusable building blocks that Create automatically generates for your application. They help create consistent, maintainable interfaces by breaking down complex UIs into smaller, manageable pieces that work seamlessly together.

Use components to:

* Break down large projects into manageable pieces
* Maintain consistency across your application
* Save development time with reusable elements
* Improve code quality and reduce complexity
* Build a library of components for your team

As your application grows, Create automatically identifies opportunities to create components, helping reduce code complexity and improve maintainability.

## Chat-based component generation

Create automatically updates your component structure as you chat about your application.

When a feature requires reusable UI elements, it:

1. **Identifies reusable patterns** in your requests
2. **Creates Components** with appropriate structure and arguments
3. **Integrates Components** into your pages and other components
4. **Maintains consistency** across your entire application

### Example: E-commerce application

If you say "Make me an e-commerce site with product cards", Create:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Creates a ProductCard component with title, price, and image fields">
    <Frame>
      <img src="/images/components/component-overview.png" />
    </Frame>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Builds a product listing page that uses the ProductCard component">
    <Frame>
      <img src="/images/components/using-components.png" />
    </Frame>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Automatically reuses the ProductCard component across your application">
    <Frame>
      <img src="/images/components/component-arguments.png" />
    </Frame>
  </Step>
</Steps>

As you continue describing your application, Create updates your component structure to match your requirements.

## Common component creation methods

Here are common ways to create components through chat:

### Automatic generation

Create automatically generates components when you:

* Describe complex UI patterns (navigation, forms, layouts)
* Request reusable elements that appear multiple times
* Build interactive features (modals, tooltips, dropdowns)

### Manual requests

You can also explicitly request components:

```
Create a button component with primary and secondary variants
```

## Managing components

You can manage your components in several ways:

* **Rename**: Click the project group selector dropdown > Click component name to edit
* **Duplicate**: In Canvas Mode, click the element's top left corner menu > Duplicate
* **Delete**: In Canvas Mode, click the element's top left corner menu > Delete

When you delete a component, you'll need to remove or replace it anywhere it's used in your application.

## Style your components

Transform component appearance using simple prompts:

```
Update the button component with a modern glass theme, style fonts similar to Apple.com
```

### Styling options

- **Screenshots** pasted in chat - see our [prompting guide](/prompting)
- **URLs** in chat - Create screenshots any URL and adds it to context
- [**Integrations**](/builder/integrations) for component packs like shadcn/ui
- [**Style Guides**](/builder/style-guides) for consistency

## Add components

Use the `/` command menu to add components to any page or other component:

* Type `/` in chat
* Select your component
* Describe how you want to use it
* Send message to integrate

<Frame>
  <img src="/images/components/using-components.png" />
</Frame>

After updating a component, you'll need to click "Update" wherever it's used to see the changes.

## Updating components

When you make changes to a component, you'll need to update any pages or components that use it:

* Find the places where you integrated the component
* Click the "Update" button next to the component integration
* Create will refresh the component with your latest changes

Changes to components don't automatically update everywhere they're used. This helps prevent unwanted changes from breaking your application.

## Common component types

Consider making components for:

* Navigation elements (headers, footers, menus)
* UI patterns (cards, lists, tables)
* Form elements (inputs, buttons, selectors)
* Layout sections (hero areas, feature grids)
* Interactive elements (modals, tooltips)

These are just suggestions - you can make components for anything you need.

## Arguments

Components can accept arguments to customize their appearance or behavior. For example:

* Button text and colors
* Card content and images
* Form field labels and validation
* Section headings and descriptions

To add arguments, describe what you want the component to accept.

**Example prompt**: "Create a banner component that accepts:

* Title
* Subtitle
* CTA text
* Background image
* Theme (light/dark)"

<Frame>
  <img src="/images/components/component-arguments.png" />
</Frame>

<Frame>
  <img src="/images/components/component-pages.png" />
</Frame>

You'll want to explain how to use these arguments.

Later, when using the component, Create will guess the right values to pass in for the component's arguments from its context, or you can be explicit about what you want.

## Variants

Components can have multiple variations for different contexts. For example:

* Sizes (small, medium, large)
* Layouts (horizontal, vertical)
* Types (success, warning, error)
* Theme variations (light, dark, branded)

To create variants:

**Example prompt**: "Add variants to the button component:

* Primary: solid background, white text
* Secondary: outlined, colored text
* Danger: red background for destructive actions"

<Frame>
  <img src="/images/components/variant-example-1.png" />
</Frame>

<Frame>
  <img src="/images/components/variant-example-2.png" />
</Frame>

## Preview stories

Preview stories help you test how your component works with different inputs. They show examples of your component in action, letting you verify that it works correctly in various scenarios. Create automatically generates these previews to help you validate your component's design and functionality.

### Preview scenarios

* Different text lengths and content
* Various image sizes
* Multiple color themes
* Custom argument combinations

The preview wraps your component in a container that lets you:

* Change the preview width
* Test responsive layouts
* See how it looks embedded in other components
* Verify spacing and alignment

Control previews by describing what you want to test:

**Example prompt**: "Show preview stories with:
* Short vs long text content
* Light and dark themes
* Different container widths (mobile to desktop)
* Various image aspect ratios"

While you'll see all preview stories on the component's canvas, when you use the component in your application, you'll only see the specific instance you create. The preview stories help you test and validate your component but don't affect how it works in your final application.
