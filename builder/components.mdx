## Overview

Components are reusable building blocks that Create automatically generates for your application. They help create consistent, maintainable interfaces by breaking down complex UIs into smaller, manageable pieces that work seamlessly together.

We use components to:

* Break down large projects into manageable pieces
* Maintain consistency across your application
* Save development time with reusable elements
* Improve code quality and reduce complexity
* Build a library of components for your team

As your application grows, Create automatically identifies opportunities to create components, helping reduce code complexity and improve maintainability.

## Chat-based component generation

Create automatically updates your component structure as you chat about your application.

When a feature requires reusable UI elements, it:

1. **Identifies reusable patterns** in your requests
2. **Creates Components** with appropriate structure and arguments
3. **Integrates Components** into your pages and other components
4. **Maintains consistency** across your entire application

### Example: E-commerce application

If you say "Make me an e-commerce site with product cards", Create:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Creates a ProductCard component with title, price, and image fields">
    <Frame>
      <img src="/images/components/component-overview.png" />
    </Frame>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Builds a product listing page that uses the ProductCard component">
    <Frame>
      <img src="/images/components/using-components.png" />
    </Frame>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Automatically reuses the ProductCard component across your application">
    <Frame>
      <img src="/images/components/component-arguments.png" />
    </Frame>
  </Step>
</Steps>

As you continue describing your application, Create updates your component structure to match your requirements.

## Common component creation methods

Here are common ways to create components through chat:

### Automatic generation

Create automatically generates components when you:

* Describe complex UI patterns (navigation, forms, layouts)
* Request reusable elements that appear multiple times
* Build interactive features (modals, tooltips, dropdowns)
