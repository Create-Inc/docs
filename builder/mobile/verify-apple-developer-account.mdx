<Warning>
  **New accounts**: Apple Developer Accounts typically take 3 days from purchase to process and may require ID verification. You'll receive a "Welcome to The Developer Program" email when your account is ready. You cannot publish apps until your account is fully active.
</Warning>

## Quick Checklist

Use this checklist to verify your Apple Developer Account is active and ready to use:

- [ ] **Membership Status** shows "Active" (not Pending, Expired, or Incomplete)
- [ ] **Program Type** shows Individual or Organization
- [ ] You can access **App Store Connect** dashboard
- [ ] **Agreements** are Active (no pending or expired agreements)
- [ ] **Paid Apps Agreement** is Active (required for monetization)
- [ ] **Banking and Tax Information** is complete (required for receiving payments)

If all items are checked ✅, your account is ready to publish and monetize apps!

## Step-by-Step Verification

### 1. Check Membership Status

1. Go to [developer.apple.com/account](https://developer.apple.com/account)
2. Sign in with your Apple ID
3. Click **Membership** in the left menu
4. Verify:
   - **Program Type**: Should show "Individual" or "Organization"
   - **Status**: Must show **"Active"** ✅

<Warning>
  If you see "Join the Apple Developer Program" or the status is not Active, your enrollment isn't complete. Complete your enrollment or contact Apple Support.
</Warning>

### 2. Verify App Store Connect Access

1. Go to [appstoreconnect.apple.com](https://appstoreconnect.apple.com)
2. Sign in with the same Apple ID
3. You should see the main dashboard with options like:
   - Apps (or "My Apps")
   - Users and Access
   - Sales and Trends

<Warning>
  If you see a message saying you're not enrolled or don't have access, your account is not ready. Complete your enrollment on the Apple Developer site or contact Apple Support.
</Warning>

### 3. Check Agreements Status

Agreements must be active before you can publish apps. **For monetization, banking and paid apps agreements are critical:**

1. In [App Store Connect](https://appstoreconnect.apple.com), click **Agreements, Tax, and Banking** (under Business menu)
2. Verify all required agreements show **"Active"**
3. **Check Paid Apps Agreement** - Must be Active if you plan to monetize your app
4. **Verify Banking Information** - Complete all required banking details to receive payments from Apple
5. **Verify Tax Information** - Complete tax forms (W-9 for US, or equivalent for your country)
6. Check for any items marked:
   - ❌ Pending
   - ❌ Incomplete
   - ❌ Expired

<Warning>
  **For Monetization**: You cannot receive payments from Apple until the **Paid Apps Agreement** is Active and your **Banking and Tax information** is complete. These are required even if your app is free but includes in-app purchases or subscriptions.
</Warning>

## Common Issues

<Note>
  If you are having trouble with submitting your app in our system, such as not seeing a confirmation from Apple after submission, the following items are the most common culprits!
</Note>

### Account Still Processing

If your account shows "Pending" or you can't access App Store Connect:
- Wait for Apple's email confirmation ("Welcome to The Developer Program")
- Check your email for any verification requests from Apple
- New accounts typically take 3 days from purchase to process

### Expired Membership

If your membership shows "Expired":
- Renew your membership at [developer.apple.com/account](https://developer.apple.com/account)
- You cannot publish apps with an expired membership

### Agreements Not Active

If agreements show as Pending or Incomplete:
- **Complete Banking Information** - Required to receive payments. Go to Agreements, Tax, and Banking and add your bank account details
- **Complete Tax Information** - Required for all developers. Submit W-9 (US) or equivalent tax form for your country
- **Accept Paid Apps Agreement** - Required for any monetization (paid apps, in-app purchases, subscriptions)
- Review and accept any pending agreements
- Contact Apple Support if issues persist

<Note>
  **Important for Monetization**: Even if your app is free, you must complete banking and tax information and accept the Paid Apps Agreement if you plan to offer in-app purchases or subscriptions through RevenueCat or other payment systems.
</Note>
