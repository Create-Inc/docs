title: "Pages"
description: "The create builder will automatically generate pages for you as you instruct it. Pages are the screens of your site or app. You start with a blank page when you open a new project."

You can build powerful apps using a single page. As your project grows, you may want to split different parts into separate pages.

### Create a Page

You start with a blank page. To create a new one, instruct the builder:

```
add a new page called Contact.
```

![Newpage Gi](/images/newpage.gif)

Pages auto-name based on their content. Rename by instructing the builder

```
Rename bio to biography in the URL structure
```

### Using Multiple Pages

```
Move the "About" section from the Contact Us Page to its own Page titled "About."
```

Consider splitting your app into multiple pages when:

- Different sections serve distinct purposes (e.g. home, about, contact)
- You want separate views for different user types (e.g. customer-facing vs admin pages)
- You need to [restrict access to certain users](/builder/user-accounts)

<Tip>
  A single page can include many [components](/builder/components) and complex logic. Many apps work well with just one page.

## Style Your Pages

Make pages look good using just a prompt\!

```
Update the look of this entire application with a modern glass theme, style fonts similar to Apple.com
```

## Requiring Authentication

You can restrict page access to signed-in users:

```
Enable user accounts, require a user be signed in to view the following pages...
```

Users will:

- See content when signed in
- Get redirected to login when not
