1. [Builder](/create/builder-add-ons)

Pages are the screens of your site or app. You start with a blank page when you open a new project. Learn more about getting started in our [builder basics guide](/create/getting-started/builder-basics).

You can build powerful apps using a single page. As your project grows, you may want to split different parts into separate pages.

### Create a Page

You start with a blank page. To create a new one:

* **Logo menu** in the top left corner > New Page OR press `option-N` (or `alt-N` on Windows)

Pages auto-name based on their content. Rename by:

* Tapping the project selector dropdown

* Using the 3-dot menu next to the page name

### Using Multiple Pages

Consider splitting your app into multiple pages when:

* Different sections serve distinct purposes (e.g. home, about, contact)

* Your page code gets long (>1500 lines) - shorter pages help Create generate more accurate code

* You want separate views for different user types (e.g. customer-facing vs admin pages)

* You need to [restrict access to certain users](/create/builder-add-ons/user-accounts)

A single page can include many [components](/create/builder-add-ons/components) and complex logic. Many apps work well with just one page.

### Style Your Pages

Make pages look good using:

* **Screenshots** pasted in chat - see our [prompting guide](/create/getting-started/guide-to-prompting)

* **URLs** in chat - Create screenshots any URL

* [**Integrations**](/create/builder-add-ons/integrations) for component packs like shadcn/ui

* [**Style Guides**](/create/builder-add-ons/style-guides) for consistency

* [**Components**](/create/builder-add-ons/components) for reusable elements

### Add Elements

Use `/` command menu to add:

* [**Components**](/create/builder-add-ons/components) for UI elements

* [**Integrations**](/create/builder-add-ons/integrations) for AI services

* [**Databases**](/create/builder-add-ons/databases-beta) for data storage

* [**Functions**](/create/builder-add-ons/functions) for backend logic

Learn more about all available elements in our [overview](/create/builder-add-ons/overview).

After you add an element to a page, if you later update it, you will see a "Elements are out of date" warning in the page. Hit 'Update' to update the page with the latest element version.

### Publishing

To publish:

* Tap **Publish** in top right

* Choose pages to make live

* Set routes (e.g. `/about`)

* Only published pages are accessible

Routes are URL paths to your pages (e.g. yourdomain.com/about). Keep pages private by not publishing them.

Read more about publishing in our [publishing guide](/create/publish-and-share/publish).

### Link Pages

1. Select Mode:

   * Tap element

   * Choose "Link" in chat

   * Pick target page/URL

2. Prompts:

   * Set routes when publishing

   * Tell Create what should happen with the routes (e.g. "When clicking the About button, go to the /about page")

   * Code updates automatically

### Requiring Authentication

You can restrict page access to signed-in users:

1. Enable [User Accounts](/create/builder-add-ons/user-accounts)

2. Page > 3-dot menu > Settings > "Require account to view"

3. Publish changes

Users will:

* See content when signed in

* Get redirected to login when not
