title: "Pages"
description: "The Anything builder will automatically generate pages for you as you instruct it. Pages are the screens of your site or app. You start with a blank page when you open a new project."

You can build powerful applications using a single page. As your project grows, you may want to split different sections into separate pages for better organization.

## Create pages

You start with a blank page. To create a new one, instruct the builder:

```
add a new page called Contact.
```

Pages are automatically named based on their content. Rename them by instructing the builder:

```
Rename bio to biography in the URL structure
```

## Manage multiple pages

```
Move the "About" section from the Contact Us Page to its own Page titled "About."
```

Consider splitting your application into multiple pages when:

- Different sections serve distinct purposes (e.g., home, about, contact)
- You want separate views for different user types (e.g., customer-facing vs admin pages)
- You need to [restrict access to certain users](/builder/user-accounts)

<Tip>
  A single page can include many [components](/builder/components) and complex logic. Many applications work well with just one page.
</Tip>

## Style your pages

Transform page appearance using simple prompts:

```
Update the look of this entire application with a modern glass theme, style fonts similar to Apple.com
```

```

## Require authentication

You can restrict page access to signed-in users:

```
Enable user accounts, require a user be signed in to view the following pages...
```

Users will:

- See content when signed in
- Be redirected to login when not authenticated

## Delete pages

Simply ask the builder:

```
Delete my biography page
```
