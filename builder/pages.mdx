title: "Pages"
description: "The create builder will automatically generate pages for you as you instruct it. Pages are the screens of your site or app. You start with a blank page when you open a new project."

You can build powerful apps using a single page. As your project grows, you may want to split different parts into separate pages.

### Create a Page

You start with a blank page. To create a new one, instruct the builder:

```
add a new page called Contact.
```

![Newpage Gi](/images/newpage.gif)

Pages auto-name based on their content. Rename by instructing the builder

```
Rename bio to biography in the URL structure
```

### Using Multiple Pages

```
Move the "About" section from the Contact Us Page to its own Page titled "About."
```

Consider splitting your app into multiple pages when:

- Different sections serve distinct purposes (e.g. home, about, contact)
- You want separate views for different user types (e.g. customer-facing vs admin pages)
- You need to [restrict access to certain users](/builder/user-accounts)

<Tip>
  A single page can include many [components](/builder/components) and complex logic. Many apps work well with just one page.

## Style Your Pages

Make pages look good using just a prompt\!

``` filename
Update the look of this application with a modern glass theme, style fonts similar to Apple.com
```

- **Screenshots** pasted in chat - see our [prompting guide](/prompting)
- **URLs** in chat - Create screenshots any URL and adds it to context
- [**Integrations**](/builder/integrations)  for component packs like shadcn/ui
- [**Style Guides**](/builder/style-guides) for consistency
- [**Components**](/builder/components) for reusable elements

## Add Elements

Use `/` command menu to add:

- [**Components**](/builder/components) - or UI elements
- [**Integrations**](/builder/integrations) - for AI services
- [**Databases**](/builder/databases) - for data storage
- [**Functions**](/builder/functions) - for backend logic

Learn more about all available elements in our [overview](/builder/overview).

## Publishing

To publish:

- Tap Publish in the top right

<Info>
  Routes are URL paths to your pages (e.g. yourdomain.com/about). Keep pages private by not publishing them. If you need to preview, use our [demo or preview modes](/essentials).
</Info>

Read more about publishing in our [publishing guide](/publish-and-share/publish).

## Adding Links

Instruct the builder on where to link and it will do the rest:

- "Link the bio page to the biography link at the homepage"
- Change links at anytime with new instructions

## Requiring Authentication

You can restrict page access to signed-in users:

```
Enable user accounts, require a user be signed in to view the following pages...
```

Users will:

- See content when signed in
- Get redirected to login when not

Learn more about [User Accounts](/builder/user-accounts).

## Deleting a Page

Simply ask the builder\!

- "Delete my biography page"
