Pages are the screens of your site or app. You start with a blank page when you open a new project. 

You can build powerful apps using a single page. As your project grows, you may want to split different parts into separate pages.

## Create a Page

You start with a blank page. To create a new one:

* **Logo menu** in the top left corner > New Page OR press `option-N` (or `alt-N` on Windows)

Pages auto-name based on their content. Rename by:

* Tapping the project selector dropdown

* Using the 3-dot menu next to the page name

## Using Multiple Pages

Consider splitting your app into multiple pages when:

* Different sections serve distinct purposes (e.g. home, about, contact)

* Your page code gets long (>1500 lines) - shorter pages help Create generate more accurate code

* You want separate views for different user types (e.g. customer-facing vs admin pages)

* You need to [restrict access to certain users](/builder/user-accounts)

<Tip>
A single page can include many [components](/builder/components) and complex logic. Many apps work well with just one page.
</Tip>

## Style Your Pages

Make pages look good using:

* **Screenshots** pasted in chat - see our [prompting guide](/prompting)

* **URLs** in chat - Create screenshots any URL and adds it to context

* [**Integrations**](/builder/integrations) for component packs like shadcn/ui

* [**Style Guides**](/builder/style-guides) for consistency

* [**Components**](/builder/components) for reusable elements

## Add Elements

Use `/` command menu to add:

* [**Components**](/builder/components) for UI elements

* [**Integrations**](/builder/integrations) for AI services

* [**Databases**](/builder/databases) for data storage

* [**Functions**](/builder/functions) for backend logic

Learn more about all available elements in our [overview](/builder/overview).

<Info>
After you add an element to a page, if you later update it, you will see a "Elements are out of date" warning in the page. Hit 'Update' to update the page with the latest element version.

## Publishing

To publish:

* Tap **Publish** in top right

* Choose pages to make live

* Set routes (e.g. `/about`)

* Only published pages are accessible

<Info>
Routes are URL paths to your pages (e.g. yourdomain.com/about). Keep pages private by not publishing them.
</Info>

Read more about publishing in our [publishing guide](/publish-and-share/publish).

## Link Pages

1. Select Mode:

   * Tap element

   * Choose "Link" in chat

   * Pick target page/URL

2. Prompts:

   * Set routes when publishing

   * Tell Create what should happen with the routes (e.g. "When clicking the About button, go to the /about page")

   * Code updates automatically

## Requiring Authentication

You can restrict page access to signed-in users:

1. Enable [User Accounts](/builder/user-accounts)

2. Page > 3-dot menu > Settings > "Require account to view"

3. Publish changes

Users will:

* See content when signed in

* Get redirected to login when not
