User Accounts add authentication and user management to your app. They handle sign-up, sign-in, and user data storage automatically.

## Why Use User Accounts

User Accounts offer several benefits:

* **Private pages** - Require sign-in to view certain [Pages](/create/builder-add-ons/pages)

* **Protected actions** - Gate [Functions](/builder/functions) behind authentication

* **Personalization** - Store and show user-specific content in [Databases](/create/builder-add-ons/databases-beta)

* **Grow your users** - Let people sign up and join your community

## Getting Started

Enable User Accounts in two steps:

1. **Enable for Project**:

   * Open Create logo menu

   * Choose "Enable User Accounts"

   * Signup, Signin, Logout pages and a Users database gets created automatically

2. **Protect Content**:

   * Open page/function settings (3-dot menu > Settings > "Require sign in to view")

   * Enable "Require sign in to view"

   * Publish to apply changes

## How Authentication Works

When you enable User Accounts, Create adds:

* **Authentication Pages**:

  * `/account/signin` - Sign in page

  * `/account/signup` - Sign up page

  * `/account/logout` - Logout page

  * Link to these pages directly for custom flows

* **Users Database**:

  * Stores user accounts automatically

  * Built-in fields: email, password (hashed)

  * Add custom fields as needed using [Databases](/create/builder-add-ons/databases-beta)

* **Access Control**:

  * Protected pages redirect to sign in

  * After auth, users return to original page

  * Functions can check user status

  * Link between pages normally - auth handles protection

<Info>
Create handles auth redirects automatically. Link pages as you normally would - the auth system manages access control.
</Info>

## How It Works Under The Hood

Create uses JWT (JSON Web Token) authentication to manage user sessions:

* When users sign up or sign in, Create stores a secure cookie in their browser

* This cookie keeps users logged in as they browse your app

* When users visit a protected page or use a protected function, Create checks this cookie

* If no valid cookie exists, Create redirects them to the sign-in page

* To let users log out, add a link to `/account/logout` in your app's signed-in experience

* When users visit the logout page, Create removes the cookie and ends their session

## Real World Example

Let's say you have an AI app with:

* Landing page (at `/`)

* AI homework creator (at `/app`)

To add user accounts:

1. Enable User Accounts for the project

2. Go to `/app` page > 3-dot menu > Settings > "Require account to view"

3. Publish changes

4. Now:

   * `/` remains public

   * `/app` redirects to sign-in

   * After sign-in, users access `/app`

   * Add personalization: "When user is logged in, show their profile in top right and store their AI generations in GenerationsDB with their user ID"

## Using User Data

Access user information in two ways:

1. **Direct References**:

   * Use "signed in user" in prompts

   * Example: "Show current user's email in header"

   * Create handles the code automatically

2. **Database Queries**:

   * Query Users [database](/create/builder-add-ons/databases-beta) like any other database

   * Join with other databases using user ID

   * Store user-specific data in related tables

## Roles and Permissions

Add custom roles to control access:

1. **Add Role Field**:

   * Update Users database schema

   * Add "role" or similar field

   * Set values like "admin", "member"

2. **Check Roles**:

   * Reference roles in prompts

   * Example: "If signed in user is admin, show settings"

   * Create handles the logic

## Testing

Verify your User Accounts setup:

1. Enable auth on a test page

2. Publish changes

3. Open an incognito window

4. Verify redirect to sign-in

5. Create test account

6. Confirm access after auth

## Troubleshooting

If authentication isn't working:

* Verify User Accounts is enabled for project

* Check page/function auth settings

* Review Users database contents

* Test with a fresh account

## FAQs

### Q: Can I customize the sign-in page?

Not yet, but it's on our roadmap.

### Q: Can I add social login (Google, Facebook)?

Coming soon.

### Q: Can I add fields beyond email?

Yes! Update the Users database or create related databases to store additional user information.
