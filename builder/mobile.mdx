Build iOS apps by describing what you want. Anything generates React Native code—from prompt to App Store in three steps.

<Warning>
We're continuing to add features to mobile apps with active development. Your real-world examples help us prioritize improvements. Try building different apps and tell us what works and what breaks.

## Get your app on the App Store

Follow these three steps to go from idea to published iOS app:

### 1. Design your mobile app

Describe your app idea in the builder. Anything generates React Native code with AI-designed interfaces for iOS. You get:

- **Prompt to app** - Describe your app, get working code
- **Design included** - AI designs apps like a human would
- **Full stack** - Built-in [databases](/builder/databases), [functions](/builder/functions), [auth](/builder/user-accounts), [storage](/builder/uploads), and [payments](/revenuecat)
- **Monetize with RevenueCat** - Add subscriptions, in-app purchases, and paywalls with [RevenueCat integration](/revenuecat)

### 2. Test on your iOS Device

Test your app on your iPhone using the Anything iOS App. Device features like camera, location, and sensors work on your device but not in the web preview. Learn how to test your app in our [Testing & Debugging Guide](/builder/mobile/testing).

<Warning>
  Device features like camera, location, and barcode scanning won't work in web preview. Test on your iOS device for full functionality.
</Warning>

### 3. Submit to TestFlight/Apple

Once your app is ready, deploy to the App Store via TestFlight. Follow our [iOS publishing guide](/builder/mobile/publishing-ios) for step-by-step instructions.
