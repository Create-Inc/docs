<Warning>
Mobile app support is rapidly evolving. You might encounter limitations with certain features or device capabilities. Your real-world examples help us prioritize improvements. Try building different apps and tell us what works and what breaks.
</Warning>

## Why Anything?

We're pioneering a much faster, easier way to build mobile apps.

Here's what we're working towards in this beta:

- **Prompt to app** - Just describe your app and Anything turns it into React Native code that works
- **Design out of box** - We're training our AI to design apps like a human would
- **Preview on device** - Test your creations on your phone with Expo Go
- **Full stack** - Use Anything's built-in [databases](/builder/databases), [functions](/builder/functions), [auth](/builder/user-accounts), [storage](/builder/uploads), and [payments](/stripe) - no separate backend needed
- **Instant App Store and Play Store submission** - Publish your app to the App Store and Play Store from Anything

## Getting Started

Ready to build your first mobile app? Start with our comprehensive [Getting Started Guide](/builder/mobile/getting-started) that walks you through the entire process from concept to deployment.

## What You Can Build

### Device Capabilities
Access native device features like camera, location, sensors, and more. See our complete [Device Capabilities Guide](/builder/mobile/device-capabilities) for all supported features.

### Publishing Your App
- [iOS App Store](/builder/mobile/publishing-ios) - Publish to Apple's App Store via TestFlight
- [Google Play Store](/builder/mobile/publishing-android) - Publish to Google's Play Store (coming soon)

### Testing & Quality Assurance
Ensure your app works perfectly with our [Testing & Debugging Guide](/builder/mobile/testing).





## How It Works

Anything generates React Native code and partners with ExpoGo for app preview. It generates app that can work on either iOS or Android, and use device capabilities like camera, location, etc.

The code tab reveals React Native components like `<View>`, `<Text>`, and `<TouchableOpacity>` that work across iOS and Android.

React Native code can be previewed on the web, so you can view a preview of your app in the builder as you chat with Create.

<Warning>
  Some device-specific features like camera access, location services, and barcode scanning won't work in the web preview. For the most accurate testing experience and to access all native device capabilities, use the Expo Go app to preview your application directly on your iOS or Android device.

## FAQ

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Can I convert my existing web app to mobile?">
    We've built features to support this, you can ask the builder to "generate a mobile app from this web app" and it will work to create a mobile based design of your existing web project.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Do I need to know React Native?">
    No\! Create handles all React Native code for you. Just describe what you want.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Can I publish to app stores?">
    Yes, with some manual steps during beta. We're streamlining this process so all you'll need is your Apple or Google accounts.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="What about app signing and certificates?">
    You handle app signing certificates yourself for now. We'll simplify this in future updates.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Can I use my existing Create database?">
    Yes\! Your mobile app connects to the same database as your web app.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="How do I handle different screen sizes?">
