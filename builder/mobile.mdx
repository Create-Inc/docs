<Warning>
Mobile app support is rapidly evolving. You might encounter limitations with certain features or device capabilities. Your real-world examples help us prioritize improvements. Try building different apps and tell us what works and what breaks.
</Warning>

## Why Anything?

Build mobile apps by describing what you want. Anything generates React Native code that works on iOS and Android.

**What you get:**
- **Prompt to app** - Describe your app, get working code
- **Design included** - AI designs apps like a human would
- **Test on device** - Preview with Expo Go on your phone
- **Full stack** - Built-in [databases](/builder/databases), [functions](/builder/functions), [auth](/builder/user-accounts), [storage](/builder/uploads), and [payments](/stripe)
- **Publish anywhere** - Deploy to App Store and Play Store

## Getting Started

Build your first mobile app. Follow our [Getting Started Guide](/builder/mobile/getting-started) from concept to deployment.

## What You Can Build

## How It Works

Anything generates React Native code. Preview with Expo Go on your device.

The code tab shows React Native components like `<View>`, `<Text>`, and `<TouchableOpacity>` that work on iOS and Android.
