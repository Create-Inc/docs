We're adding support for building mobile apps (iOS, Android) with Create. 

It's currently in beta for early access members. You can join our early access program at [earlyaccess.created.app](https://earlyaccess.created.app).


With our new mobile app support, you can:

- Prompt to build your native app 
- Use native device features like the camera
- Preview your app on your phone
- Use Create's AI integrations
- Build the backend of your app with Create's functions, databases, auth, payments, and more
- Publish to the App Store and Google Play (with Expo)

<Info>
    **Beta**

    Our native mobile app support is in beta and rapidly evolving. We'll add more features in the next week based on your feedback. 

    You may encounter issues with code generation and/or support for certain SDKs. Please tell us which block what you're trying to do so we can prioritize. 

    It's especially helpful for us to get many real world examples of mobile apps you'd want to build. So please try to build a few different apps, and tell us what breaks. 

    Join our [Early Access Program](https://earlyaccess.created.app) to get access, and post any and all feedback on our [Discord server](https://create.xyz/discord).

    Some obvious signs: `<View />`, `<Text />`, `<TouchableOpacity />`, `<FlatList />`, etc.

    Example:

    ```jsx
    import React, { useState } from 'react';
    import { View, Text, TouchableOpacity, StyleSheet, SafeAreaView, FlatList } from 'react-native';
    
    export default function HomeScreen() {
      const [workouts, setWorkouts] = useState([
        { id: '1', name: 'Morning Run', type: 'Cardio', duration: '30 min' },
        { id: '2', name: 'Weight Training', type: 'Strength', duration: '45 min' },
      ]);
      
      return (
        <SafeAreaView style={styles.container}>
          <View style={styles.header}>
            <Text style={styles.headerText}>Fitness Tracker</Text>
          </View>
          
          <FlatList
            data={workouts}
            keyExtractor={(item) => item.id}
            renderItem={({ item }) => (
              <TouchableOpacity style={styles.workoutCard}>
                <Text style={styles.workoutName}>{item.name}</Text>
                <Text style={styles.workoutDetails}>{item.type} â€¢ {item.duration}</Text>
              </TouchableOpacity>
            )}
          />
          
          <TouchableOpacity style={styles.addButton}>
            <Text style={styles.addButtonText}>+ Add Workout</Text>
          </TouchableOpacity>
        </SafeAreaView>
      );
    }
    
    const styles = StyleSheet.create({
      container: {
        flex: 1,
        backgroundColor: '#f5f5f5',
      },
      header: {
        padding: 16,
        backgroundColor: '#4a90e2',
      },
      headerText: {
        fontSize: 20,
        fontWeight: 'bold',
        color: 'white',
      },
      // More styles...
    });
    ```
  </Step>
</Steps>


## Creating a Mobile App

You create mobile apps by prompting:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Start a new project">
    Select "New mobile page" from the logo menu 
  </Step>

  <Step title="Describe your app">
    Tell Create what you want to build, just like with web apps:
    
    ```
    Make a fitness tracking app where users can log workouts, 
    track progress, and set goals. Include a calendar view 
    and achievement badges.
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Refine through conversation">
    Chat with Create to add features, modify designs, and customize your app:
    
    ```
    Add a barcode scanner to let users scan product nutrition labels
    ```
    
    ```
    Make the workout screen use the device's accelerometer to count reps
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Preview and iterate">
    Test your app on real devices and continue refining through chat. 

    Be specific on errors and issues you're encountering so Create can modify the code to fix it. 
  </Step>
</Steps>

Create handles all the complexity of mobile development for you, including:

* Setting up the Expo project structure
* Managing dependencies and native modules
* Configuring navigation between screens
* Implementing responsive layouts for different device sizes
* Handling platform-specific (Android, iOS) code when needed

## Previewing Your App

There are several ways to preview and test your mobile app while you build:

### On Your Physical Device

<Steps>
  <Step title="Install Expo Go">
    Install [Expo Go](https://expo.dev/client) on your iOS or Android device
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Publish your app">
    Publish your app in Create
    
    <Frame caption="Publish your mobile app">
      <img src="/images/mobile/hitpublish.png" />
    </Frame>
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Wait for processing">
    Wait 1 minute for the app to be ready to go
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Access the preview">
    Open the Publish modal, and tap "View on mobile"
    
    <Frame caption="Select 'View on mobile' to preview your app">
      <img src="/images/mobile/viewonmobile.png" />
    </Frame>
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Scan QR code">
    Scan the QR code displayed in Create's preview panel
    
    <Frame caption="Scan the QR code with your device to preview your app">
      <img src="/images/mobile/scanbarcode.png" />
    </Frame>
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Use your app">
    Your app will load instantly on your device in the Expo Go app
    
    Test it out to make sure it works as expected
    
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Tip>
  Using a physical device provides the most accurate testing experience, especially for features that use device hardware like cameras or sensors.

If you see something on this list that you desperately need for your app, please let us know in [Discord](https://create.xyz/discord) so we can prioritize adding support for it!

<Tip>
  To use a specific Expo feature, simply describe what you want to do in chat. For example: "Add a screen that lets users take photos and save them to their profile"
</Tip>

## Best Practices

For the best experience building mobile apps with Create:

1. **Start with mobile in mind** - Mention that you're building a mobile app early in your conversation

2. **Be specific about device features** - Tell Create which native capabilities you want to use

3. **Test frequently on real devices** - Mobile apps can behave differently on physical hardware

4. **Consider both platforms** - Specify if you need platform-specific behavior for iOS or Android

5. **Think about offline use** - Mobile apps often need to work with intermittent connectivity

## Limitations

While Create's mobile support is powerful, there are some current limitations to be aware of:

* **Custom native modules** - Support for adding custom native code is limited in the beta
* **Performance optimization** - Very graphics-intensive apps may require manual optimization
* **App store submission** - Currently requires manual steps (automated publishing coming soon)
