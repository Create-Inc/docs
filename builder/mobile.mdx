<Warning>
Mobile app support is rapidly evolving. You might encounter limitations with certain features or device capabilities. Your real-world examples help us prioritize improvements. Try building different apps and tell us what works and what breaks.
</Warning>

## Why Anything?

We're pioneering a much faster, easier way to build mobile apps.

Here's what we're working towards in this beta:

- **Prompt to app** - Just describe your app and Anything turns it into React Native code that works
- **Design out of box** - We're training our AI to design apps like a human would
- **Preview on device** - Test your creations on your phone with Expo Go
- **Full stack** - Use Anything's built-in [databases](/builder/databases), [functions](/builder/functions), [auth](/builder/user-accounts), [storage](/builder/uploads), and [payments](/stripe) - no separate backend needed
- **(Coming Soon) Instant App Store and Play Store submission** - Publish your app to the App Store and Play Store from Anything
