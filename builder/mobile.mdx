Create is adding support for building native mobile apps for iOS and Android. This feature is in beta for early access members.

**Join the beta:** Sign up at [earlyaccess.created.app](https://earlyaccess.created.app)

<Info>
  **Beta**

  Mobile app support is rapidly evolving. You might encounter limitations with certain features or device capabilities. 

  Your real-world examples help us prioritize improvements. Try building different apps and tell us what works and what breaks.

  Share feedback on our [Discord server](https://create.xyz/discord). Please include the /build link (URL from the builder) and a short description of what's breaking. We're especially interested in code gen or device capability errors.

## What You Can Build

With mobile app support, you can:

- Build native iOS and Android apps through chat
- Use device features like camera and location
- Preview apps on your phone
- Build full stack apps with Create's [functions](/functions), [database](/database), [user accounts](/auth), [uploads](/storage), and [payments](/payments)
- Publish to the App Store and Google Play


## Getting Started

<Steps>
  <Step title="Join Early Access">
    Sign up at [earlyaccess.created.app](https://earlyaccess.created.app)
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Create a new project">
    Start a fresh project from your dashboard
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Logo menu > New mobile page">
    Click the Logo menu and select "New mobile page"
    
    <Frame>

  </Step>
</Steps>

## How It Works

Behind the scenes, Create generates React Native code for mobile devices. The code tab reveals React Native components like `<View>`, `<Text>`, and `<TouchableOpacity>` that work across iOS and Android.

## Building Your App

<Steps>
  <Step title="Describe your app">
    Tell Create what you want to build:
    
    ```
    Make a fitness tracking app where users can log workouts, 
    track progress, and set goals. Include a calendar view.
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Add mobile features">
    Request specific mobile capabilities:
    
    ```
    Add a barcode scanner to scan product nutrition labels
    ```
    
    ```
    Let users take photos of their workout progress
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Test and refine">
    Preview on your device and make improvements through conversation.
    
    Be specific about issues so Create can fix the underlying code.
  </Step>
</Steps>

Create handles all technical details:

* Project structure setup
* Dependencies and libraries
* Screen navigation
* Responsive layouts for different devices

## Testing on Your Device

<Steps>
  <Step title="Install Expo Go">
    Download [Expo Go](https://expo.dev/client) on your iOS or Android device
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Publish your app">
    Click the "Publish" button in Create
    
    <Frame>
      <img src="/images/mobile/hitpublish.png" />
    </Frame>
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Wait for processing">
    Wait about 1-3 minute for preparation. We're working on reducing this time.
    
    When it's ready, you'll see a "View on mobile" button.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Access the preview">
    In the Publish modal, select "View on mobile"
    
    <Frame>
      <img src="/images/mobile/viewonmobile.png" />
    </Frame>
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Scan the QR code">
    Use your phone's camera to scan the QR code
    
    <Frame>
      <img src="/images/mobile/scanbarcode.png" />
    </Frame>
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Test your app">
    Your app opens in Expo Go for immediate testing
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Tip>
  Testing on a physical device provides the most accurate experience, especially for hardware features like camera or sensors.

## Publishing to App Stores

Currently, you can export your code and publish using Expo's tools.

We're building a streamlined process for direct publishing to App Store and Google Play.

## Technical Foundation

Create mobile apps are built on:

* Expo SDK 52
* React Native 0.72.x
* Expo Router for navigation

## Best Practices

1. **Start with mobile in mind** - Mention you're building a mobile app in your first prompt

2. **Specify device features** - Clearly state when you need camera, location, etc.

3. **Test on physical devices** - Mobile apps behave differently on real hardware

4. **Consider offline use** - Plan for intermittent connectivity

## Current Limitations

* **Custom native modules** - Limited support for specialized native features
* **Graphics-intensive apps** - May require manual optimization
* **App store submission** - Requires some manual steps during beta
