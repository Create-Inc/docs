<Warning>
We're continuing to add features to mobile apps with active development. Your real-world examples help us prioritize improvements. Try building different apps and tell us what works and what breaks.

## Why Anything?

Build mobile apps by describing what you want. Anything generates React Native code that works on iOS and Android.

**What you get:**
- **Prompt to app** - Describe your app, get working code
- **Design included** - AI designs apps like a human would
- **Test on device** - Preview with Expo Go on your phone
- **Full stack** - Built-in [databases](/builder/databases), [functions](/builder/functions), [auth](/builder/user-accounts), [storage](/builder/uploads), and [payments](/stripe)
- **Publish anywhere** - Deploy to App Store and Play Store

## Getting Started

Build your first mobile app. Follow our [Getting Started Guide](/builder/mobile/getting-started) from concept to deployment.

## What You Can Build

### Device Capabilities
Use camera, location, sensors, and 39+ other device features. We're adding more constantly. See the complete [Device Capabilities Guide](/builder/mobile/device-capabilities).

**Example projects:**

**Fitness Companion**
- Track runs with GPS, capture progress photos, visualize workout data with charts, schedule sessions in calendar, feel achievements with haptic feedback

**Local Business Finder**
- Discover nearby restaurants on interactive maps, get directions with location services, call businesses from contacts, browse photo galleries, work offline with smart caching

**AI Coaching App**
- Chat with AI coach via text, track progress with charts, charge for Pro features with Stripe integration, get daily reminders via notifications, store goals securely

### Publishing Your App
- [iOS App Store](/builder/mobile/publishing-ios) - Deploy via TestFlight
- [Google Play Store](/builder/mobile/publishing-android) - Deploy to Play Store (coming soon)

### Testing & Quality Assurance
Test and debug your app with our [Testing & Debugging Guide](/builder/mobile/testing).





## How It Works

Anything generates React Native code. Preview with Expo Go on your device.

The code tab shows React Native components like `<View>`, `<Text>`, and `<TouchableOpacity>` that work on iOS and Android.

Preview your app in the builder as you chat with Anything.

<Warning>
  Device features like camera, location, and barcode scanning won't work in web preview. Use Expo Go on your device for full testing.

## FAQ

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Can I convert my existing web app to mobile?">

    No\! Anything handles all React Native code for you. Just describe what you want.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Can I publish to app stores?">

  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="What about app signing and certificates?">
    You handle app signing certificates yourself for now. We'll simplify this in future updates.
