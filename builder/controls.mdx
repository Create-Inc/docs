### Chat

You chat with Create to build your app. Tell it what to build using text or images:

* You can paste imges into the chat

* Press `cmd-enter` (or `ctrl-enter` on Windows) to send messages

* Create uses your app's code and chat history to generate updates

  * Paid plans get enhanced AI generations with more context

* When you select a **specific element**, messages update only that element

* When you select the **canvas**, messages can modify multiple elements at once

Learn how to write effective prompts in our [Guide to Prompting](/create/getting-started/guide-to-prompting).

### `/` Commands

* Type `/` in the chat to open the add-ons menu

* Choose [integrations](/create/builder-add-ons/integrations) or create new elements

* Your selection appears as a special chip in chat

* Send your message to apply the command

### Top Navigation

### Canvas vs. Focused views

  * Drag and arrange elements freely

  * Generate across the project

* **Focused view**:

  * Work one element at a time

  * Fix the element's position, which helps you test scroll

  * Switch elements using project selector

### Elements
