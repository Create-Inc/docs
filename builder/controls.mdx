## Chat

You chat with Anything to build your app. Tell it what to build using text or images:

- You can paste imges into the chat
- Press `cmd-enter` (or `ctrl-enter` on Windows) to send messages
- Anything uses your app's code and chat history to generate updates
  - Paid plans get enhanced AI generations with more context

  ## Mode Switcher
  
  ![Mode Switcher](/images/modes.png)
  
- **Thinking Mode** - Our default mode, this allows the AI to generate the highest quality results and when necessary review external resources to ensure accuracy.
- **Discussion Mode** - chat without making edits. It can be important at times to prevent edits to your work and be able to ask questions of the builder about status, approach or specific features without allowing it to alter your current design.
- **Debug Mode** - This mode is designed to help you overcome issues with your app or build, simply swap to debug mode and provide a succinct description of the issue. It will work to replicate and test a fix for you. 
- **Fast Mode** - Built for speed at the expense of quality, this mode is designed to get you results quickly. It is inferior to Thinking Mode in many ways, but uses less credits to generate code.
