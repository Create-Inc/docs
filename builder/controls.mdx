## Chat

You chat with Create to build your app. Tell it what to build using text or images:

* You can paste imges into the chat

* Press `cmd-enter` (or `ctrl-enter` on Windows) to send messages

* Create uses your app's code and chat history to generate updates

  * Paid plans get enhanced AI generations with more context

* When you select a **specific element**, messages update only that element

* When you select the **project name** in the [**Project Selector**](/builder/controls#project-selector) or the **canvas**, messages can modify multiple elements at once

## Generations

Control the scope of Create's changes by selecting different elements:

* **Project**:
  * Select the **project name** in [**Project Selector**](/builder/controls#project-selector) or tap the **canvas**
  * Create can modify multiple elements at once
  * Can add new [Pages](/builder/pages), [Components](/builder/components), [Functions](/builder/functions) as needed
  * Best for building features that span elements

* **Element**:
  * Select a specific **element name** or tap it on the **canvas**
  * Changes confined to just that [Page](/builder/pages), [Component](/builder/components), or [Function](/builder/functions)
  * Best for focused updates and refinements to each element

<Tip>
See our [Guide to Prompting](/prompting#project-wide-vs-single-element) for level-specific prompting tips.

## Modes

Switch between three modes as you build:

* **Demo**: Test your app
* **Select**: Select elements for specific updates
* **Code**: View and edit code

### Demo
Test your app as users will experience it:
* Fill forms and trigger interactions
* See real-time integration updates
* Perfect for testing flows and debugging

### Select
Make updates to specific elements:
* Tap elements to make updates
* Create reusable [components](/builder/components)
* Add links between [pages](/builder/pages)
* Modify properties and styling with direct commands

### Code
View and edit code directly:
* Make precise adjustments
* Add custom logic
* Export the code as a React/Next.js project

## Views

Toggle between two views using the collapse icon:

### Canvas
See multiple elements on an infinite canvas:
* Get a bird's eye view of your project
* Drag and arrange elements freely
* Generate across the project

### Focused
Work one element at a time:
* Fix the element's position, which helps you test scroll
* Switch elements using [**Project Selector**](/builder/controls#project-selector)
