### Chat

You chat with Create to build your app. Tell it what to build using text or images:

* You can paste imges into the chat

* Press `cmd-enter` (or `ctrl-enter` on Windows) to send messages

* Create uses your app's code and chat history to generate updates

  * Paid plans get enhanced AI generations with more context

* When you select a **specific element**, messages update only that element

* When you select the *project name** in the **element selector** or the **canvas**, messages can modify multiple elements at once

<Info>

### `/` Commands

* Type `/` in the chat to open the add-ons menu

* Choose [integrations](/builder/integrations) or create new elements

* Your selection appears as a special chip in chat

* Send your message to apply the command

### Top Navigation

Key controls from left to right:

* **Logo Menu**: Create new elements ([Pages](/builder/pages), [Components](/builder/components), [Functions](/builder/functions), etc.)

* **Element Selector**: Rename the project/element, jump between different elements in your project, change the generation level

* **3 Dot Menu**: Access element settings

* **Mode Switcher**: Toggle between Demo, Select, and Code modes

* **View Switcher**: Choose between Canvas and Focused views

* **Responsive Preview**: Test responsive design (Desktop/Mobile)

* **Privacy**: Control access and team settings

* [**Invite**](/publish-and-share/teams): Add collaborators to your project

* [**Publish**](/publish-and-share/publish): Launch your app live

### Project-wide vs Single Element Generation

Control the scope of Create's changes by selecting different elements:

* **Project-wide generation**:
  * Select the **project name** in element selector or tap the **canvas**
  * Create can modify multiple elements at once
  * Can add new [Pages](/builder/pages), [Components](/builder/components), [Functions](/builder/functions) as needed
  * Best for building features that span elements

* **Single element generation**:
  * Select a specific **element name** or tap it on the **canvas**
  * Changes confined to just that [Page](/builder/pages), [Component](/builder/components), or [Function](/builder/functions)
  * Best for focused updates and refinements to each element

<Tip>
See our [Guide to Prompting](/prompting#project-wide-vs-single-element) for level-specific prompting tips.

### Demo, Select, and Code

Switch between three modes as you build:

* **Demo mode**:

  * Test your app as users will experience it

  * Fill forms and trigger interactions

  * See real-time integration updates

  * Perfect for testing flows and debugging

* **Select mode**:

  * Tap elements to make updates

  * Create reusable [components](/builder/components)

  * Add links between [pages](/builder/pages)

  * Modify properties and styling with direct commands

* **Code mode**:

  * View and edit code directly

  * Make precise adjustments

  * Add custom logic

  * Export the code as a React/Next.js project

### Canvas vs. Focused views

Toggle between two views using the collapse icon:

* **Canvas view**:

  * See multiple elements on an infinite canvas

  * Get a bird's eye view of your project

  * Drag and arrange elements freely

  * Generate across the project

* **Focused view**:

  * Work one element at a time

  * Fix the element's position, which helps you test scroll

  * Switch elements using project selector

### Version History

Keep track of changes and revert to previous versions:

* **Chat**: 
  * Tap on previous versions in the chat to jump back 
  * Hit 'Restore' to make it the current version
