Create offers 50+ built-in integrations (and growing!) to give your apps superpowers. Build AI-powered features, generate PDFs, display maps, or enhance your UI with component libraries.

<Tip>
  Missing an integration? Email us at hello@create.xyz with your suggestion. Meanwhile, you can add any API to your app using [Functions](/builder/functions). It's similar to creating your own integration.
</Tip>

## Adding Integrations

Add integrations by:

* Type `/` in chat or select "Add-ons" menu

* Select the integration

* Write a prompt on how you want to use the integration. Send the message.

You can add integrations to your [Pages](/builder/pages), [Components](/builder/components), or [Functions](/builder/functions). When you add an integration, you'll see a special chip in your chat. Create adds the integration code to your page/component/function.

<Tip>
  You need to include the integration in your prompt. You'll know it's referenced correctly if you see a chip in your chat.
</Tip>

<Info>
  Some integrations use credits to run. Learn more about [Credits](/account/credits).

## Using AI Integrations

Build powerful AI apps with our integrated models. Each integration comes with support out of box for:

* **Streaming** - AI-generated text appears word by word, real time. You can tell Create not to stream when you use the integration if you'd rather have it load.

* **Flexible Prompting** - Let Create guess the best prompt or specify the exact prompt

* **Structured Outputs** - Get JSON responses to build dynamic UIs and drive application logic

Adding AI is simple - just use a slash command, describe how you want to use the AI, and Create handles hooking it up to your app.

### Streaming

By default, responses appear word-by-word as they're generated, creating an engaging real-time experience. This works great for chatbots and interactive experiences.

If you prefer to show a loading spinner and display the complete response at once, simply tell Create "don't stream the response" in your prompt. This is useful for:

* Applications that process the full response

* UIs that need to wait for complete data

* Situations where immediate partial results aren't helpful

### Prompting

Create offers multiple ways to handle AI prompts:

1. **Basic Integration**

   * Just include the AI integration (e.g. `/[ChatGPT]`) in your message

   * Create will guess an optimal prompt based on your app's context

2. **Custom Prompts**

   * Specify exactly what you want: "Use /\[ChatGPT] with prompt: 'Analyze this text for tone'"

   * Control the exact behavior of the AI

3. **Dynamic Variables**

   * Use `[brackets]` for dynamic values

   * Example: "Take in a subject line from the user. Then use /\[ChatGPT] with prompt: 'Generate a concise email for \[subject line]'"

   * Create handles all the code to pass variables to your prompts. You can chain multiple variables

4. **Prompt Optimization**

   * Let Create help: "Optimize the prompt for /\[ChatGPT]. I want to \[your goals]"

   * Create will craft an effective prompt for your AI integration and include them in the code to call the integration

### Structured Outputs

While AI typically returns raw text, you can request JSON responses for more structured data handling.

**Common Use Cases:**

1. **Building UIs**

```javascript
   // Example: "Generate a recipe as JSON and show UI for each step"
   {
     "title": "Chocolate Cake",
     "steps": [
       {"step": 1, "instruction": "Preheat oven..."},
       {"step": 2, "instruction": "Mix ingredients..."}
     ]
   }   
```

1. **Driving Logic**

````javascript
   // Example: "Analyze text sentiment as JSON"
   {
     "sentiment": "positive",
     "score": 0.8,
     "key_phrases": ["excellent service", "highly recommend"]
   }   ```
````

**Important Notes:**

* JSON responses automatically disable streaming

* Remember to handle loading states

* Great for when you need to process or display data programmatically

* See [Structured Outputs](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/structured-outputs) for more examples
