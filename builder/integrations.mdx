<Warning>
  As we transition to our new builder integrations may be temporarily unavailable. We are working to improve their functionality and compatibility with the new system. If you have questions on specific integrations please email us at [hello@create.xyz](mailto:hello@create.xyz). Thank you\!
</Warning>

Anything offers 50\+ built-in integrations (and growing\!) to give your apps superpowers. Build AI-powered features, generate PDFs, display maps, or enhance your UI with component libraries.

<Tip>
  Missing an integration? Email us at [hello@create.xyz](mailto:hello@create.xyz) with your suggestion. Meanwhile, you can add any API to your app using [Functions](/builder/functions). It's similar to creating your own integration.
</Tip>

## Adding Integrations

Add integrations by:

- Type `/` in chat or select "Add-ons" menu
- Select the integration
- Write a prompt on how you want to use the integration. Send the message.

You can add integrations to your [Pages](/builder/pages), [Components](/builder/components), or [Functions](/builder/functions). When you add an integration, you'll see a special chip in your chat. Anything adds the integration code to your page/component/function.

<Tip>
  You need to include the integration in your prompt. You'll know it's referenced correctly if you see a chip in your chat.
</Tip>

<Info>
  Some integrations use credits to run. Learn more about [Credits](/account/credits).

## Using AI Integrations

Build powerful AI apps with our integrated models. Each integration comes with support out of box for:

- **Streaming** - AI-generated text appears word by word, real time. You can tell Anything not to stream when you use the integration if you'd rather have it load.
- **Flexible Prompting** - Let Anything guess the best prompt or specify the exact prompt
- **Structured Outputs** - Get JSON responses to build dynamic UIs and drive application logic

Adding AI is simple - just use a slash command, describe how you want to use the AI, and Anything handles hooking it up to your app.

### Streaming

By default, responses appear word-by-word as they're generated, creating an engaging real-time experience. This works great for chatbots and interactive experiences.

If you prefer to show a loading spinner and display the complete response at once, simply tell Create "don't stream the response" in your prompt. This is useful for:

- Applications that process the full response
- UIs that need to wait for complete data
- Situations where immediate partial results aren't helpful

### Prompting

Create offers multiple ways to handle AI prompts:

1. **Basic Integration**
   - Just include the AI integration (e.g. `/[ChatGPT]`) in your message
   - Anything will guess an optimal prompt based on your app's context
2. **Custom Prompts**
   - Specify exactly what you want: "Use /[ChatGPT] with prompt: 'Analyze this text for tone'"
   - Control the exact behavior of the AI
3. **Dynamic Variables**
   - Use `[brackets]` for dynamic values
   - Example: "Take in a subject line from the user. Then use /[ChatGPT] with prompt: 'Generate a concise email for [subject line]'"
   - Create handles all the code to pass variables to your prompts. You can chain multiple variables
4. **Prompt Optimization**
   - Let Anything help: "Optimize the prompt for /[ChatGPT]. I want to [your goals]"
   - Anything will craft an effective prompt for your AI integration and include them in the code to call the integration

### Structured Outputs

While AI typically returns raw text, you can request JSON responses for more structured data handling.

**Common Use Cases:**

1. **Building UIs**

```javascript
   // Example: "Generate a recipe as JSON and show UI for each step"
   {
     "title": "Chocolate Cake",
     "steps": [
       {"step": 1, "instruction": "Preheat oven..."},
       {"step": 2, "instruction": "Mix ingredients..."}
     ]
   }   
```

1. **Driving Logic**

````javascript
   // Example: "Analyze text sentiment as JSON"
   {
     "sentiment": "positive",
     "score": 0.8,
     "key_phrases": ["excellent service", "highly recommend"]
   }   ```
````

**Important Notes:**

- JSON responses automatically disable streaming
- Remember to handle loading states
- Great for when you need to process or display data programmatically
- See [Structured Outputs](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/structured-outputs) for more examples
