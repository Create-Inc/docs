Create offers 50+ built-in integrations (and growing!) to give your apps superpowers. Build AI-powered features, generate PDFs, display maps, or enhance your UI with component libraries.

Missing an integration? Email us at hello\@create.xyz with your suggestion. Meanwhile, you can add any API to your app using [Functions](/create/builder-add-ons/functions). It's similar to creating your own integration!

### Adding Integrations

Add integrations by:

* Type `/` in chat or select "Add-ons" menu

* Select the integration

* Write a prompt on how you want to use the integration. Send the message.

You can add integrations to your [Pages](/builder/pages), [Components](/builder/components), or [Functions](/builder/functions). When you add an integration, you'll see a special chip in your chat. Create adds the integration code to your page/component/function.

Some integrations use credits to run. Learn more about [Credits](/create/account/credits).

### AI & LLMs

Build AI apps with our AI integrations. All offer:

* Streaming responses by default - text appears word by word. You can also tell Create not to stream when you use the integration.

* Flexible prompting - let Create suggest prompts or specify your own

* Structured outputs - get JSON responses to build UIs and logic (see [Structured Outputs](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/structured-outputs))

It just takes a slash command, and Create adds the AI api to your app.
