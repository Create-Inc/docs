Uploads let users add files to your app - like images, PDFs, documents, audio, and videos. Build galleries, AI tools that process text or documents, or just let users set profile pictures.

### Why Use Uploads

Uploads enable several capabilities:

* **File sharing** - Let users upload and share files

* **Galleries** - Build collections of images or videos

* **Documents** - Handle PDFs and other documents

* **User specific content** - Allow profile pictures and submissions with [User Accounts](/builder/user-accounts)

### Adding Uploads

Add uploads to any [Page](/builder/pages), [Component](/builder/components), or [Function](/builder/functions) by prompting Create to handle uploads:

1. **Describe the upload flow**:

   * UI elements (buttons, drag areas)

   * Success/error states

   * What happens after upload

2. **Choose upload method**:

   * File selector

   * Drag and drop

   * URL input

   * Copy/paste

3. **Handle the file**:

   * Store URL in database

   * Display preview

   * Process content

Example prompts:

* "Add an image upload button to the form that shows a preview after its uploaded"

* "Let users drag PDFs to upload and store in /\[Database]"

* "Create a profile picture uploader with cropping. Store the URLs in /\[UsersDB]"

Create will write the code to support uploads based on your prompt. We recommend specificity in how you want to support uploads. Some common details to include:

1. UI around uploads

2. How the app should handle different states (uploads, error, success, etc.)

3. How the app should use the upload

Create automatically:

* Stores files securely

* Returns permanent URLs for the file stored on Create's cloud

* Handles file serving when you use the URL

To save uploads:

* Store URLs in [Databases](/create/builder-add-ons/databases-beta)

* Reference URLs in your app

* Query stored URLs later from the database

<Tip>
Always store upload URLs in a database if you need to access files later. Without storage, URLs exist but are hard to find.
</Tip>

<Info>
Create offers several integrations to help process uploaded files:

* [File Conversion](/create/builder-add-ons/integrations#file-conversion) - Convert between file formats like PDF, images, and more

* [GPT-4 Vision](/create/builder-add-ons/integrations#gpt-4-vision) - Analyze uploaded images

* [Document Scanner](/create/builder-add-ons/integrations#document-scanner) - Extract text from scanned documents

* [Audio Transcription](/create/builder-add-ons/integrations#audio-transcription) - Convert audio files to text
</Info>

### Technical Details

**Supported Upload Methods**:

* File upload

* URL import

* Base64 data

* Array buffers

**Considerations**:

* 10MB max file size

* Common web formats supported

* Files stored in Create's cloud

<Info>
Add file size validation to prevent errors from large uploads. Just prompt Create to show an error if your users upload a larger file size.
