Style Guides help you create professional-looking apps without specifying every design detail. They automatically apply consistent styling across your entire project.

### Why Use Style Guides

Style Guides offer several benefits:

* **Professional design** - Created by expert designers

* **Consistent look** - Every page and component matches

* **Faster development** - Skip detailed design instructions

* **Project-wide styling** - One style for your whole app

* **Brand matching** - Custom guides for Business users

### Available Styles

Choose from:

* 20 pre-made professional styles

* Custom style guides (Business plan)

* More styles added regularly

<Tip>

### How It Works

Style Guides automatically:

* Apply consistent colors

* Set typography

* Define spacing

* Match component styles

* Maintain visual hierarchy

When you create new elements, Create follows your chosen style without extra prompting.


### Updating Styles

When you change your Style Guide:

* You need to regenerate the [pages](/builder/pages) / [components](/builder/components) to use that style

* New elements follow the style

<Info>
Style Guides affect your entire project. This ensures all pages and components look like they belong together.

### Examples

Here's how the same content looks with different Style Guides:

Try different styles to find the right look for your project.

If elements don't match your selected Style Guide, tell Create to "follow the Style Guide" in your prompt after your selection. This helps Create apply the correct styles.
