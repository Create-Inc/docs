Max is our highest tier AI agent, an autonomous software engineer that builds, tests, and fixes your applications automatically. Give it a goal, and Max will work through your app like a real user, writing code and tests until the task is complete.

## What Makes Max Different

Anything already lets you build products without coding. So what's new about Max?

**It builds for you.**

We gave Max eyes, hands, and more intelligence and autonomy. Max sees and uses your app. It operates on its own live or in the background. Like a real engineer.

- Max runs your app in a full browser. It looks at it the way a user does and notices what happens as it tries it.
- Max uses your app like a person. It scrolls, types, clicks, logs in, uploads, checks out to try end to end flows.
- It keeps going on its own. Goal → try the app → change something → try again, until solved. It sometimes runs for 100+ steps and 30+ minutes (but usually it solves it faster)

Max is a personal product engineer designed to help anyone ship complex projects.

## Getting Started

**Requirements**: Anything subscription ($200+/month) + credits for Max tasks

**Start a Max task**:
1. Select Max from the mode switcher in an active project
2. Give it a goal in natural language:
   - "Add swipe gestures to navigate between screens"
   - "Implement push notifications for new messages"
3. Launch Max and watch it work
4. Wait for agent to report its work as completed

## Use Cases

**Nuanced issues or problems in your application**
- "Users sometimes get logged out when refreshing"
- "Checkout fails randomly on mobile"
- "Double charges on fast taps"

**Features you want shipped without babysitting**
- "Add user onboarding flow"
- "Implement search functionality"
- "Repair drag and drop functionality"

**Pre-launch QA across all key flows**
- Run multiple Max instances in parallel
- Test signup, payment, invites simultaneously
- Launch with confidence everything works

## Real Examples

**Broken checkout flow**
- Max walked through the Stripe integration step-by-step
- Identified timing issues with payment initialization
- Fixed loading states and error handling
- Result: 100% checkout success rate

**Mobile double-submit bug**
- Max emulated fast thumb taps to reproduce the issue
- Added client-side submission locking
- Implemented server-side idempotency keys
- Result: Zero duplicate charges

## Parallel Processing

Max can run multiple concurrent tasks simultaneously, allowing you to tackle complex projects with multiple features or bugs in parallel.

### Feature and Bug Fixing Swarms

Start multiple Max instances to work on different aspects of your application simultaneously:

- **Feature Development**: Run separate Max tasks for different features
- **Bug Fixing**: Deploy multiple agents to tackle different issues
- **Testing**: Parallel testing across different user flows
- **Optimization**: Multiple agents working on performance improvements

This parallel approach dramatically reduces development time and allows you to ship complex updates faster.

## Pricing

Available to all **$200+/mo** subscribers. Each Max task uses credits based on job size.
