Functions are automatically created by the builder, to enable you to build powerful backend logic by transforming your natural language into code. They handle complex operations while keeping your UI clean and focused.


## Benefits of functions

Functions offer several key advantages:

- **Transform words into logic** - Describe what you want in plain language and Anything generates the code
- **Separate UI from logic** - Keep pages focused on presentation while Functions handle complex operations
- **Test in isolation** - The builder can debug independenlty of design and UI
- **Reusable** - Use Functions across pages and components once they're working
- **External APIs** - Functions can connect securely to thousands of APIs using [Secrets](#secrets)


### Example: Document analysis application

Imagine building an application that analyzes documents with AI:

**Without Functions** - everything in one place:
- Upload interface for PDFs
- Code to display the document
- AI analysis of images
- AI text summarization
- Error messages
- Loading screens

**With Functions** - split into manageable parts:

**Page:**
- A clean upload interface
- Document display
- A button that calls your analysis Function

**Function:**
- AI image analysis
- AI text summarization
- Error handling

This separation makes your application easier to build, test, and maintain.
