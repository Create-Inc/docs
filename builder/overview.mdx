### You chat with Create to build sites and full-stack web apps.

Create automatically layers in pages, features and components to build for you.

<Tip>
  What is a 1-3 sentence summary of your ideal app or website, try to summarize its core functions into your initial prompt. Remember to be clear about desired type, "Mobile App that does x" is different than "I want a  website that does x"
</Tip>

For example, if I've been hoping to build a mobile application for my detailing business, I might say:

```

I need a mobile app for my car detailing business where customers can book appointments with me!
```

### This sets in motion a build that will begin to take shape right in front of you:

### The AI Agent begins to translate your instruction into the foundation of your desired mobile app.

<Note>
  As it begins to write the code of your application its building with specific elements
</Note>

- [**Pages**](/builder/pages) - the design screens of your application, your user interface
- [**Components**](/builder/components) - reusable elements for designs like a Navigation Bar for the mobile app, seen on every screen in the design
- [**Integrations**](/builder/integrations) third party features or capabilities to power specific parts of your experience, like an AI chat assistant for end users
- [**Functions**](/builder/functions) - used for powering your frontend (web and mobile,) writing saves or grabs from the database, or connecting to external things like APIs.
- [**Databases**](/builder/databases) to store and persist data, this is your storage system for information
- [**User Accounts**](/builder/user-accounts) to manage users and authentication, control access
- **Assets** to upload and manage images, logos, and more

### I can now work to revise and improve the initial design

Rarely are you going to have a complete feature ready app with just one prompt, but as you can see in the GIF above, we're pretty close\!

```

Can we do a chrome theme with muted blue tones?
```

<Tip>
  And now I have a new version of the application, with a color theme I like, that I might want to further iterate on.
</Tip>

```

Allow users to load photos of their cars as a part of the booking process
```

### Let's do some testing\!

<Tip>
  To test the photo feature and app overall I will use [ExpoGo](/builder/mobile) on my phone
