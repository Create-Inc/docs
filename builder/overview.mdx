You chat with Create to build sites and full-stack web apps. Create lets you add and combine elements to build your app.

## Elements

* [**Pages**](/builder/pages) to design screens of your app

* [**Components**](/builder/components) to build reusable UI elements

* [**Integrations**](/builder/integrations) to add AI and more capabilities in seconds

* [**Functions**](/builder/functions) to add backend logic and external APIs

* [**Databases**](/builder/databases) to store and persist data

* [**User Accounts**](/builder/user-accounts) to manage users and authentication

* **Assets** to upload and manage images, logos, and more

<Info>
You begin your project on a single page. Create guides you through adding elements, and in some cases, makes them for you.

To make new elements:

* Type `/` in the chat

* OR open the Create logo menu in the top left
