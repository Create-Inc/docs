</Frame>

## Overview

Every Create project comes with a free database built in. As you chat with Create, it handles all database details - from designing the structure to writing the code that lets your app save and retrieve data from it.

Use databases to:

* Store user submissions (forms, feedback, uploads)

* Save content (blog posts, products, galleries)

* Persist data between uses of the app

* Build dynamic data-driven features


## Chat

Create automatically updates your database structure & how your app retreives and stores data as you chat.

When a feature requires storing data, it:

1. **Designs the database structure**based on your description

2. **Makes Functions**to save and retrieve data from the database

3. **Designs the Pages and Components**to display and interact with the data

4. **Connects everything**to make sure your Pages use the Functions that retrieve/store data.

For example, if you say "Make me a tasks app", Create:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Creates a tasks table with title, due date, and other fields">
    <Frame>
      <img src="/images/databases/viewer.png" />
    </Frame>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Creates Functions to save and fetch tasks">
    <Frame>
      <img src="/images/databases/tasks-functions.png" />
    </Frame>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Builds a Page with a task list and add form">
    <Frame>
      <img src="/images/databases/tasks-ui.png" />
    </Frame>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Makes your Page use your Functions to save and grab tasks from the database">
    <Frame>
      <img src="/images/databases/tasks-connected.png" />
    </Frame>
  </Step>
</Steps>

As you continue describing your app, Create updates your database structure, Functions and Pages to match what you want.

Here are common ways to modify your database through chat:

### Setting the scene

It helps to start with a specific description of what you want your app to do.

Prompt:

```
Make a tasks app. Users should be able to add, view, and delete tasks. 

Each task has title, description and comments

Comments should show up under the task and show who wrote them.  
```

Create will:

* Make the tables needed

  * Make a Tasks table with title, description, and comments fields

  * Make a Users table with name and avatar fields

  * Make a Comments table with text and author fields

* Create Functions to save and fetch tasks, users, and comments

* Build a Page with a task list, add form, and comment list

* Make the Page use your Functions to save tasks when submitted and grab tasks to display

### Adding Fields

```
Add a description to todos. Show it below the title in italics.
```

Create will:

* Add the description column to the Todos table

* Update Functions to handle the new field

* Modify the UI to display descriptions

### Removing Fields

```
Remove the priority from todos, we won't use it anymore
```

Create will:

* Remove the priority column

* Update queries to exclude the field

* Clean up any UI elements showing priority

### Adding Tables

```
Let users add comments on todos. Each comment should have the text and who wrote it
```

Create will:

* Make a new Comments table

* Link it to the Todos table

* Add UI for viewing/adding comments

* Handle saving comments to the database

### Changing Structure

```
Instead of due dates, let's use status (Todo, In Progress, Done) to track progress
```

Create will:

* Convert the due\_date field to a status field

* Update existing data

* Modify the UI to show status options

### Relationships

```
Let users assign todos to team members. Show their avatar next to each todo
```

Create will:

* Add user relationships to todos

* Update queries to fetch user data

* Show assignee info in the UI

### Filling Data

```
Generate 10 sample todos with different statuses and assignees
```

Create will:

* Generate 10 sample todos with different statuses and assignees based on your structure

* Insert the data into your database

* Preserve relationships between tables

### Validation

```
Make sure every todo has a title
```

Create will:

* Add validation rules to the database

* Update Functions to check data

* Show validation errors in the UI

<Tip>
  Always describe both what data you want to store AND how you want to use it. This helps Create build the right database structure, Functions, and UI.
</Tip>

<Tip>
  The more specific you are in your prompt, the better Create can help.

  If you describe something at a high level, "make a todo app", Create will guess what fields each todo should have.

  If you describe what you want in detail, "make a todo app with a title, due date, and priority field", Create will make sure each todo has those fields.
</Tip>

## Viewing & Editing Data

Create comes with a built-in database viewer for manual edits to your data. You can quickly verify that data is being stored in the right way when you use your app.

Access it from:

* Chat - tap the database

* [Project Selector](/builder/controls#project-selector)- choose your database name

The database viewer lets you:

* See all tables

* Edit individual rows

* Sort and filter data

* Download data in bulk

* Run custom SQL queries to fetch data

You can also make your own internal tools to update multiple tables at once:

* Make a new[Page](/builder/pages)

* Describe your tool and how it should update the database

* Try out your UI

<Info>
  Changes in Demo mode in the Builder use a test database. This lets you experiment safely without affecting your live data.
</Info>

## Test vs. Live DB

Create maintains separate test and live databases for each project:

**Test Database**

* Used in Demo mode from the builder

* Allows you to make sure your app is saving data correctly before publishing

**Live Database**

* Used in your published app

* Access your live database from the builder

### Publishing

When you publish your app, Create automatically:

* Creates your live database

* Applies the latest structure from the Test database to your Live database so that it has the same tables and fields

* Runs your app with that structure

<Warn>
  When making changes to your database structure after publishing, be careful about conflicts with your live database. For example:

  * You make an app that has a User table with email, image, and phone fields

  * You publish your app so your live database has the same tables. You launch it and users start signing up.

  * You later decide that you don't need phone numbers, so in an update to the app you remove it.

  * You try to publish your app again. Your live database now has users with with phone numbers.

  * Create will warn you about this conflict on publish. If you publish, it will remove the existing phone numbers.

  This is called a "migration conflict". You've changed the structure of your test database, but it now conflicts with your live database structure.

  To resolve migration conflicts:

  1. Check the error message for details

  2. Either:

     * Modify your test database to match production (keep "phone" around)

     * Manually migrate the live data (move data from "phone")

  3. Try publishing again

  Create warns you about destructive changes before your publish to protect your live data.
</Warn>

## Errors

Here are some good ways to troubleshoot common errors:

### Data isn't saving or retrieving

If data isn't saving when you use your app, there are 3 common failure points to check. Go in this order to test each isolation:

#### 1. Database Structure

**How to check:**

* Open the database viewer

* Verify tables and fields match what you expect

**If there's an issue:**

* Describe the correct structure you want in chat

* Example: "Update the Tasks table to have title, description, and dueDate fields"

* Create will modify the database to match

#### 2. Function -> Database

**How to check:**

* Identify which function saves or retrieves data from the database. Tap on it.

* Open the[Test Runner](/builder/functions#test-runner)(3-dot menu > Test)

* Enter sample data and run the test

* Check database viewer to verify data was saved

* Delete test records if needed

**If there's an issue:**

* Copy any error messages

* Paste them into the function chat

* Ask Create to fix the specific error

* Example: "I see this error when I run saveTask and test it with this data: \[error] \[example data]"

#### 3. UI -> Function

**How to check:**

* Try the app in Demo mode from the UI

* Check that data is being saved when you use the app in the database viewer

* Verify your page/component references the correct function

* Type`/`in chat to see if function is linked

* Try the flow in Demo mode

* Watch database viewer to see if records appear

**If there's an issue:**

* Verify your page/component references the correct function

* Example: "Connect the taks form to the saveTask function when I submit a task"

* Create will update the code to properly wire everything together

<Tip>
  For any errors you encounter, you can paste them directly into Create's chat. It often recognizes specific error patterns and knows how to fix them.
</Tip>

## Reset

When you publish your app, Create pushes your test database structure to your live database. If you continue making changes to your test database structure in the builder and don't like the changes, you can reset to the structure of your last published version.

<Frame caption="Reset your database structure to match your published app">
  <img src="/images/databases/reset-db.png" />
</Frame>

This is helpful when:

* You've made experimental changes you don't want to keep
* Your database structure has become complex or incorrect
* You want to start fresh from your last stable version

To reset your database structure:

1. Open your database in the builder
2. Look for the "Reset" button in the top right corner
3. Confirm that you want to reset to the published version

<Warn>
  Resetting your database structure will revert all schema changes made since publishing. This includes removing any tables or fields added since the last publish. Any data in those tables or fields will be lost.
</Warn>

## Removing Multiple Databases

In 99.99% of cases, you don't need multiple databases per project. A single database can have an arbitrary number of tables. It's easy to add more tables (just describe what you want to store, and Create adds a table for it). It's better to have multiple tables in the same database than multiple databases as it makes joins easier.

If you have multiple databases, you can remove ones you don't need:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Tap on the database you want to remove in the builder">
    Select the database from the project selector 
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Look for the 'Remove from Project' button">
    Top right corner next to Reset and View Live

    <img src="/images/databases/remove-from-project.png" />
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Confirm removal">
    Verify you want to remove this database from your project
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Info>
  If you had data in the database you removed, you can ask Create to update your single database with tables that support all of your use cases. It will update the remaining database to have multiple tables instead of having multiple databases.
</Info>

<Tip>
  Before removing a database, make sure you understand which app features are using it. Create will attempt to warn you if removing a database would break functionality.
</Tip>

## Using an Existing Database

Create will automatically create a new database for your project. However, there are some scenarios where you might want to use an existing database for a new project:

* You already have data in one database that you want to reuse for a new app 
* You're making a new app or frontend for the same data (e.g. an internal tool or another app)

To add an existing database to your project:

1. Go to the new project 
2. Press `/` > Databases > select the database you want to use 
3. Prompt Create on what you want to build with the database chip in the chat 

<Info>
  When you add an existing database to a project, both projects will share the same data. Changes made in one project will be visible in the other.
</Info>

<Tip>
  This approach is excellent for creating multiple views of the same data, such as customer-facing apps alongside internal admin tools.
</Tip>

If you no longer want to use this database in your project, you can [remove it from the project](#removing-multiple-databases).

## Helpful Database Terms

Create handles the technical details of your database, but understanding some key concepts can help you work more effectively.

Think of a database as a collection of connected spreadsheets:

* A **table** is like a spreadsheet (e.g., "Users", "Products")
* **Fields** (or columns) are the types of information stored (e.g., "name", "email") 
* **Rows** are individual entries
* **Relationships** connect data between tables using **foreign keys**

Key terms explained:

| Term | Definition | Example |
|------|------------|---------|
| **Schema** | The structure of your database (tables and fields) | Your app's blueprint showing Users table with name, email fields |
| **Query** | Instructions to get or save data | "Get all products where price < $100" |
| **Join** | Combining data from different tables | Showing posts with their authors' names from the Users table |
| **Foreign Key** | A field that references another table | Post's `authorId` connects to User's `id` |
| **SQL** | The language databases understand | Create writes this for you! |
| **Migration** | Changes to your database structure | Adding a "phone" field to Users table |

<Tip>
  Don't worry about memorizing these! Just describe what data you want to store and how you want to use it - Create handles the technical implementation.
