## Additional Debug Mode Content Removed

### Content from builder/controls.mdx

#### Debug Mode Description
```mdx
- **Debug Mode** - This mode is designed to help you overcome issues with your app or build, simply swap to debug mode and provide a succinct description of the issue. It will work to replicate and test a fix for you.
```

### Other Debug-Related Content to Consider
- Various mentions of "debugging" in mobile testing documentation
- Debug-related content in essentials.mdx, prompting.mdx, and other files
- Consider if these should also be removed or if they refer to general debugging concepts rather than the specific Debug Mode feature
