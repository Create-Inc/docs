RevenueCat is a subscription management platform for mobile apps. It helps you manage subscriptions, in-app purchases, and paywalls—but payments are processed by Apple through their App Store payment system.

<Note>
  RevenueCat is for mobile apps. If you want to monetize a web app, use [Stripe](/stripe).
</Note>

## Why Use RevenueCat

RevenueCat manages subscription logic and entitlements for iOS apps, while Apple processes all payments. RevenueCat handles:
- Subscription status tracking and entitlements
- Paywall templates and A/B testing
- Revenue analytics and customer management
- Cross-platform subscription sync

**How payments work:**
- Users pay through Apple's in-app purchase system (Apple Pay, credit cards, etc.)
- Apple processes the payment and takes their commission
- RevenueCat tracks the purchase and unlocks features in your app
- You receive payouts from Apple, not RevenueCat

## Prerequisites

Before setting up RevenueCat, you'll need:
- An iOS mobile app project in Anything
- An [App Store Connect](https://appstoreconnect.apple.com) account with an active developer program membership
- A [RevenueCat](https://www.revenuecat.com) account

## Setup

### Connect Your Accounts

<Steps>
  <Step title="Navigate to Settings">
    Go to **Dashboard > Settings > Accept Payments > Mobile**
    <Frame>
      <img src="/images/revcat.png" />
    </Frame>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Connect App Store Connect">
    Connect your App Store Developer account to enable in-app purchases and subscriptions.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Connect RevenueCat">
    Connect your RevenueCat account to manage payments and subscriptions.
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Add RevenueCat to Your Project

<Steps>
  <Step title="Open Your Project">
    Navigate to your mobile app project in the Anything builder.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Ask the Agent">
    In the chat, ask the agent to add RevenueCat + App Store Connect integration:
    ```
    "Add RevenueCat + App Store Connect to this project"
    ```
  </Step>
  <Step title="Configure Products">
    The agent will help you set up your subscription tiers and products. You can define:
    - Subscription plans (monthly, yearly, etc.)
    - One-time purchases
    - Entitlements that unlock features in your app
  </Step>
</Steps>

## How It Works

RevenueCat integrates automatically with your mobile app. Here's the flow:

1. **Products are configured** in both App Store Connect and RevenueCat
2. **Users make purchases** through Apple's in-app purchase system (they see Apple's payment UI)
3. **Apple processes the payment** and takes their commission (typically 15-30%)
4. **RevenueCat receives the purchase event** from Apple and tracks subscription status
5. **RevenueCat unlocks features** in your app based on entitlements
6. **You receive payouts** from Apple (not RevenueCat) according to Apple's payout schedule

RevenueCat is the subscription management layer—Apple is the payment processor. No code required—Everything is handled through prompts and configuration.

## Testing

### TestFlight (Sandbox Testing)
Test your RevenueCat integration in [TestFlight](https://developer.apple.com/testflight/) before releasing to the App Store. TestFlight uses Apple's sandbox environment, which allows you to:
- Test purchases without real charges
- Simulate subscription states and payment flows
- Validate paywall functionality before going live
- Test on real devices with sandbox Apple ID accounts

<Note>
  In sandbox environments, subscription renewals occur every 24 hours (regardless of subscription duration) to speed up testing cycles.
</Note>

### Production
Once your app is approved and released:
- Real payment processing through Apple's App Store
- Automatic App Store compliance
- Live analytics and customer management in your RevenueCat dashboard
