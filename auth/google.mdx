title: "Google Sign In"
description: "Let users sign in to your app with their Google account"
---

Let users sign in to your app with their Google accounts. They'll share their email, name, profile picture, and language settings.

You'll need to set up a few things in Google first, then add those settings to Anything.

## Before You Start

Make sure you have:

<Check>
  An Anything project with [User Accounts](/builder/user-accounts) turned on
</Check>

<Check>
  Your app running on a custom domain through [Anything's domain setup](/publish-and-share/custom-domains)
</Check>

<Warning>
  Google Sign In needs a custom domain - you can't use the default `created.app` domains. You'll need:
  - A domain you own
  - [Anything Pro subscription](https://create.xyz/pricing)
  - DNS records properly configured
</Warning>

## Troubleshooting

<Accordion title="Can't see the Google button">

  - Check that your Client ID and Client Secret are correctly pasted in Anything
  - Ensure your domain is added as an Authorized JavaScript Origin in Google Cloud
  - Verify your app is published and accessible at your custom domain

    In Google Cloud, always use 'www.your-domain.com' not just 'your-domain.com'. Many login problems happen because people forget the 'www'.
  </Tip>
