## How It Works

When users sign up with email/password:

1. The password is securely hashed using bcrypt before storage

2. The email and hashed password are stored in your database:
   - Email in `auth_users.email`
   - Hashed password in `auth_accounts.password`
   - Account type set to "credentials"

3. On sign in, Create:
   - Hashes the provided password
   - Compares it to the stored hash
   - Creates a secure session if they match

## Customizing the Form

You can customize the email/password form through chat:

```
Make the sign in form match our brand colors
```

```
Add password requirements text under the password field
```

Create will update the form while maintaining the secure authentication logic.

## Testing

1. Publish your changes
2. Open your app in a new incognito window
3. Go to the sign in page
4. Try signing up with email/password
5. Check the [auth_users table](/builder/databases) to see your new user

## Troubleshooting

<Accordion title="Can't see the email/password form">
  - Check if User Accounts is turned on
  - Make sure Email/Password Sign In is enabled in Project Settings
  - Try publishing your changes again
  - Clear your browser data and try in incognito mode
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Sign in not working">
  - Double check the email address is correct
  - Make sure you're using the right password
  - Try resetting your password (see FAQ below)
  - Check the auth_users and auth_accounts tables
</Accordion>

## FAQ

<Accordion title="Can I reset passwords?">
  You can manually reset passwords in the database. We're adding support for automated workflows soon. For now:
  - Delete the user from the database
  - Ask them to sign up again
  - Optionally update the new user's ID to match the old ID to maintain data connections
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Can I customize password requirements?">
  Yes! Just prompt Create with your desired requirements like:
  "Make passwords require at least 8 characters with one number"

  It will add validation to the password field. 
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Can I add additional fields to sign up?">
  Yes! Prompt Create to add fields like name or phone number to the sign up form.
</Accordion>
