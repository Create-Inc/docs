<warn>
This article is outdated and will be updated soon to reflect new capabilities in Anything to have the builder offload all primary work to connect to external APIs, just by showing it documentation.
</warn>

Functions let you connect to any external API by turning your words into code. This guide will show you how, using the [Exa AI Search API](https://exa.ai/) as an example.

Watch this step-by-step tutorial to see these principles in action:

## Step-by-Step Guide

<Steps>
  <Step title="Create a New Function">
    Start by creating a Function using any of these methods:
    * Logo Menu > New Function
    * Press `option-F` (or `alt-F` on Windows)
    * Type `/` in chat > Create Function
  </Step>

  <Step title="Find API Documentation">
    1. Locate the API documentation for your service
    2. Find the specific endpoint you want to use
    3. Copy the documentation URL or endpoint details
    
    For example, with Exa:
    ```bash
    https://docs.exa.ai/reference/search
    ```

    <Tip>
      You can paste API documentation URLs directly into the Function chat - Anything will screenshot them and write the necessary code.
    </Tip>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Add API Credentials">
    Most APIs require authentication. Add your credentials as secrets:
    1. Open the "Secrets" panel from your Function's 3-dot menu
    2. Click "+ Add a new secret"
    3. Name it clearly (e.g. "EXA_API_KEY" for Exa)
    4. Enter your API key or token
    
    <Warning>
        Always use Secrets to store sensitive credentials.
    </Warning>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Configure the Function">
    Tell Anything what you want the Function to do:
    1. Paste the API documentation URL
    2. Describe the desired inputs and outputs
    3. Specify any error handling needs

    Example prompt for Exa:
    ```
    Create a search function that:
    - Takes a search query as input
    - Uses the Exa API endpoint from docs.exa.ai
    - Returns the search results
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Test the Integration">
    Verify your setup using the Function test panel:
    1. Open the 3-dot menu > Test
    2. Enter sample data
    3. Click "Run Test"
    4. Check the response
    
    <Tip>
      If you get errors, paste them back into your Function chat. Anything often knows how to fix specific API issues.
    </Tip>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Build the Frontend">
    Add your Function to a page or component:
    1. Type `/` in chat
    2. Select your Function
    3. Describe how you want to use it
    
    Anything will handle:
    * Loading states
    * Error messages
    * UI around the results
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Common API Patterns

When working with external APIs:

* **Authentication**: Most APIs require credentials (API keys, tokens, etc.)
* **Error Handling**: Plan for different types of errors and prompt Anything how you want to handle
* **Data Transformation**: You may need to format data before/after API calls

<Note>
Functions have a 5-minute timeout. For longer operations, consider chaining multiple Functions together.
</Note>

## Alternative Integration Methods

Can't find an API's documentation? You can also:

* Use automation platforms like [Zapier or Make](/quick-tips/zapier-make-n8n)
* Screenshot API documentation for Anything to analyze
* Paste example CURL commands or request formats
