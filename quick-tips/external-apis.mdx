## Overview

Anything now supports direct API connections through the builder! Simply discuss your API needs with the builder and provide the necessary connection information. No more manual Function creation required.

Watch this tutorial to see how easy it is to connect external APIs:

## Step-by-Step Guide

<Tip>
  Consider using [Discussion Mode](/essentials#discussion-mode) to plan your API integration before implementing it. This mode helps you explore options and get recommendations without making immediate changes to your code.
</Tip>

<Steps>
  <Step title="Start the Conversation">
    Switch the builder into Discussion Mode and begin by telling it about your API needs:
    
    ```
    "I want to connect to a pet facts API to display random facts"
    "I need to integrate with the Google Maps API for location services"
    "Connect my app to the SendGrid API for email notifications"
    ```
    
    **Alternative approach:** If you already know the API you want, you can link the builder to it and ask for the perfect prompt:
    
    ```
    "I want to use the Spotify API. Here's the documentation: https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api
    
    Can you create the perfect prompt for me to integrate this into my music app?"
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="The builder will respond with the ideal prompt for you to use">
    <Frame>

    </Frame>
    
    **Example prompt:**
    ```
    "I want to connect to the OpenWeatherMap API. Here's the documentation: 
    https://openweathermap.org/api
    
    Can you help me design a prompt to integrate this API into my weather app?"
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Change out of discussion mode to execute">
    Using the prompt generated during step 2, paste that into the builder chat with Thinking Mode enabled and submit.
    
    The builder will work to integrate the API per your instructions.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Add API Credentials">
    If prompted, store your API credentials securely:
    
    1. Go to **Project Settings** > **Saved Secrets**
    2. Click **"+ Add a new secret"**
    3. Name it clearly (e.g., "PAYMENT_API_KEY")
    4. Enter your API key or token
    
    <Note>
      Not all APIs require authentication keys. Some public APIs can be accessed without credentials.
    </Note>
    
    <Warning>
      Always use Saved Secrets to store sensitive credentials. Never hardcode API keys in your prompts.
    </Warning>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Test and Refine">
    Test your API integration:
    
    - Use **[Preview Mode](/builder/controls#demo-code-and-preview)** to test the full user experience
    - Check that API calls work correctly
    - Verify error handling and edge cases
    
    If something isn't working, simply tell the builder what's wrong and it will fix it.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Common API Integration Examples

### Email Services (SendGrid, Mailgun)
```
"Connect to SendGrid to send welcome emails when users sign up, 
and order confirmation emails when they make a purchase."
```

### Maps and Location (Google Maps, Mapbox)
```
"Add Google Maps to show nearby restaurants. Users should be 
able to see their location and get directions to restaurants."
```

### Social Media APIs (Twitter, Instagram)
```
"Connect to Twitter API to display recent tweets on my homepage 
and allow users to share content to their Twitter accounts."
```

### Weather and Data APIs
```
"Add weather information to my app using the OpenWeatherMap API. 
Show current weather and 5-day forecast for the user's location."
```

## Best Practices

### Security
- **Always use Saved Secrets** for API keys and tokens
- **Never share credentials** in chat or code
- **Use environment variables** for different environments (dev/prod)

### Error Handling
- Let the builder know how you want to handle API failures
- Specify user-friendly error messages
- Plan for rate limiting and timeouts

### Performance
- Consider caching for frequently accessed data
- Use pagination for large datasets
- Implement proper loading states

## Troubleshooting

### API Connection Issues
If your API integration isn't working:

1. **Check credentials**: Verify API keys are correct and active
2. **Review API limits**: Ensure you haven't exceeded rate limits
3. **Check documentation**: Make sure you're using the correct endpoints
4. **Ask the builder**: Describe the error and let the builder help fix it

### Common Error Messages
- **"Invalid API key"**: Check your credentials in Saved Secrets
- **"Rate limit exceeded"**: Implement proper rate limiting or upgrade your API plan
- **"Endpoint not found"**: Verify the API endpoint URL and method

## Alternative Integration Methods

For complex integrations or when direct API connection isn't suitable:

- **Automation platforms**: Use [Zapier or Make](/quick-tips/zapier-make-n8n) for no-code integrations
- **Webhooks**: Set up webhook endpoints for real-time data
