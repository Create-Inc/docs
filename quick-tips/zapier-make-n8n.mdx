## Step-by-Step Integration

### Create a Zapier Webhook

<Steps>
  <Step title="Create a New Zap">
    Go to [Zapier](https://zapier.com/) and click "Create Zap"
  </Step>
  <Step title="Select Webhook Trigger">
    Choose "Webhooks by Zapier" as your trigger app
    Select "Catch Raw Hook" as the trigger event
  </Step>
  <Step title="Copy Webhook URL">
    Zapier will generate a unique webhook URL - copy this for the next step
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Make a Function in Anything

<Steps>
  <Step title="Create a New Function">
    In your Anything project, go to the Functions tab and click "New Function"
  </Step>
  <Step title="Prompt">
    Say you want to send data to Zapier. Anything will recognize it and ask you for the webhook URL.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Add Webhook URL">
    Add a new secret called `ZAPIER_WEBHOOK_URL` and paste your Zapier webhook URL
  </Step>
  <Step title="Write Your Prompt">
    Write a prompt that specifies:
    - What data to collect from the user
    - When to trigger the webhook
    - What data to send to Zapier
    
    Example prompt:
    ```
    Take in name, email, generate message body with /ChatGPT, and then send this data to Zapier using the webhook URL stored in ZAPIER_WEBHOOK_URL
    ```
  </Step>
  <Step title="Test the Connection">
    Click "Generate" in Anything and test your function
    Check Zapier to confirm the test data was received
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Extend in Zapier

<Steps>
  <Step title="Add Zapier Actions">
    Add subsequent steps in your Zap to:
    - Send emails
    - Update spreadsheets
    - Create CRM records
    - And more
  </Step>
  <Step title="Turn On Your Zap">
    Once testing is successful, turn on your Zap
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Use your Function in Anything

You can now use your function in Anything. For example, you can use it in a page, or another function. Just press / to reference it and Anything will hook it up. 

You now have an app that can trigger its own workflows in Zapier with custom information. You can use that inforamtion in downstream automations.  

<Tip>
  For security, always use environment variables or secrets to store webhook URLs, never hardcode them in your functions.
</Tip>

## Data Format

When sending data to Zapier, Anything will automatically format it as JSON. Example payload:

```json 
{
"name": "John Doe",
"email": "john@example.com",
"timestamp": "2024-03-21T10:30:00Z"
}
```
