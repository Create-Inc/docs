1. [QUICK TIPS](/create/quick-tips)

When you use AI integrations in Create, like ChatGPT or Claude, the AI models will often output text with [Markdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown) formatting. Markdown is an easy-to-read, lightweight markup language that is much simpler than HTML. It indicates which parts of text are headings, have bold or italic style, are bulleted lists, etc.

In Create, you can use our built-in Markdown Renderer to easily display correctly formatted output from AI models. All you have to do is type `/` and select `Markdown Renderer` from the list of integrations and Create will automatically update your project code.
