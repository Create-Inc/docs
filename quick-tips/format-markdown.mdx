## Overview

When using AI integrations like ChatGPT or Claude in Anything, the output often includes [Markdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown) formatting. Our built-in Markdown Renderer helps you display this content beautifully with minimal effort. Markdown is a lightweight markup language that's much simpler than HTML, making it perfect for indicating headers, lists, bold text, and more.

## How to Use

<Steps>
  <Step title="Generate Markdown Content">
    Use any AI integration (like ChatGPT or Claude) and specifically ask it to format its response using markdown. For example:
    ```
    Write a blog post about AI and format it using markdown with headers, lists, and emphasis
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Add the Markdown Renderer">
    Type `/` and select `Markdown Renderer`. Tell Anything to use it to display your AI-generated content. For example:
    ```
    Display the AI's response using the Markdown Renderer
    ```
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Supported Formatting

The Markdown Renderer supports:

* **Headers** (# H1, ## H2, etc.)
* *Italic* and **bold** text
* Bulleted and numbered lists
* [Links](https://create.xyz)
* Code blocks with syntax highlighting
* Tables
* And more!

<Note>
The Markdown Renderer converts markdown syntax into HTML elements. This means you can style these elements using CSS to customize how your AI-generated content looks. Just tell Create how you want to style specific elements like headers, paragraphs, or lists.
</Note>
