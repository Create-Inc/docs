1. [QUICK TIPS](/create/quick-tips)

In Create, it's possible to connect to any workflow automation tool, like Zapier, Make.com, n8n, etc. using functions. For a full, step-by-step guide on how to do this, check our [functions docs](https://docs.create.xyz/create/builder-add-ons/functions#external-apis).

Or follow along in this YouTube video tutorial, where we'll connect [Zapier](https://zapier.com/) to a Create project using "webhook" triggers:

* Make a new function in Create

* Create a new Zap

* Add the webhook step

* Copy the webhook URL

* Paste it as a secret in your Create function

* Write a prompt telling Create to take certain data fields as input and send them to Zapier

* Click Generate

* Test the connection

* Add any other steps to your Zap, like sending an email, writing data to a Google Sheet, adding records to your CRM, etc.
