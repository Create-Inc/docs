Understanding Credits

Credits power select integrations in your Create apps. All plans come with credits.

<Info>
**Introducing Credits** During our 30-day rollout period (until Jan 18th), integrations run even if you're over your limit. After that, integrations pause when credits run out. Track your usage and upgrade if needed.

## Plans

Each plan includes monthly credits:

* **Free**: 2k credits airdropped for free to try AI integrations

* **Pro**: 10k credits/month included as part of your plan

* **Business**: 50k credits/month included as part of your plan

* **Enterprise**: Custom credits per month

Paid plans offer monthly credit refills and bulk discounts.

Reach out to [customers@create.xyz](mailto:customer@create.xyz) if you need a custom plan for your apps' expected usage.

## How Credits Work

Credits are shared across all your team's projects.

Credits are used when your app runs an integration that costs credits. Only select integrations use credits - many run for free. Add Functions with your own API keys for credit-free alternatives.

AI integrations cost credits based on:

* The AI model you choose

* How many tokens you use per run

You can test your integration in Demo mode to track credit usage. Often, you can achieve the same result and optimize costs by using fewer tokens per run or a cheaper AI model. Once you publish, integrations that use credits will spend them as users use your app.

As you run your integrations, you can see actual usage from your apps from the Subscription & credits section of the dashboard.

## Rollover and Refills

Your credits work on a monthly cycle:

* Credits refill on your billing date

* Purchase additional credits anytime if you're running low in a month

* Upgrade your plan for higher monthly refills

Unused credits roll over to the next month.

## Limits

You'll receive email alerts from hello\@create.xyz as you near your credit limit.

If you reach your credit limit:

* Credit-based integrations pause

* All other app features continue working

Go to the dashboard to upgrade your plan or purchase additional credits.

## Viewing usage

You can check your usage as your apps run integrations from:

* **Credits** icon in the top left corner of the builder

* **Subscription & credits** in the dashboard

* **Email alerts** from hello\@create.xyz as you approach or reach your credit limit
