## How Credits Work

Credits are used in two main ways:

1. **AI generations**
   - Anything generates your app as you send messages.
   - Anything uses many AI models to generate code, images, and more for your app when you send messages.
   - Anything uses a model and task dependent number of credits per message (typically 100-500 credits per message, but it can be more or less).
2. **AI Integrations**
   - You can include AI integrations in your app
   - When your app runs an AI integration, it uses credits per run
   - Only select integrations use credits - many run for free
   - You can add Functions with your own API keys for credit-free alternatives
   - Integrations use a model and input/output dependent number of credits per run

# Purchasing and Managing Credits

All plans come with a set number of credits per month.

- Monthly credits refill on your billing date to your selected monthly plan
- Unused monthly credits expire at the end of your billing cycle
- Paid members can purchase top-off credits anytime if you need a few more in a month. Top-off credits do not expire.
- Upgrade your plan for higher monthly limits

## Top-Off Credits

- \$12 for 10k credits
- \$60 for 50k credits
- \$120 for 100k credits
- \$240 for 200k credits

<Tip>
  Subscriptions come with a 10%+ discount. It's often cheaper to upgrade your subscription if you're purchasing top-off credits often.
</Tip>

You can view usage, change your plan, and purchase additional credits from Subcription & credits tab in the [dashboard](https://create.xyz/dashboard).

## Optimizing Credit Usage

Here are some tips to make the most of your credits:

- **Use Discussion Mode** - Plan your changes and integrations in [Discussion Mode](/essentials#discussion-mode) first to avoid unnecessary iterations
- **Be specific with prompts** - Clear, detailed prompts reduce the need for follow-up messages. Review our [prompting guide](/prompting) for optimal results
- **Test in Preview Mode** - Use [preview mode](/essentials#view-modes) to test edits before moving on to other features
- **Focus on one issue at a time** - Address problems individually rather than trying to fix multiple issues in one message
- **Learn to triage effectively** - Watch our [triage guide](/support/help#how-to-triage) to efficiently troubleshoot and debug issues

<Tip>
  The most efficient approach is to plan in [Discussion Mode](/essentials#discussion-mode), then execute in Thinking Mode with a single, well-crafted prompt.
</Tip>

## Hitting your limit

When you hit your credit limit, you'll need to upgrade your plan or purchase additional credits to keep building or have your integraitons run.

If you run out of credits while building, Anything will prompt you to upgrade your plan when you send your next message.

As apps you create start using credits for integrations, Anything sends you an email alert from `hello@createanything.com` as you near your limits.

Track your credit usage from:

- **Subscription & credits** in the dashboard
- **Email alerts** as you approach your limit
