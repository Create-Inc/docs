Create understands both **text** and **images** to build your app. You'll get better results if you're clear. Soon, you'll notice it's way faster than coding.

<Info>
**Prompting** is a fancy word for "writing instructions to an AI". AI models can make mistakes, so there are better and worse ways to write the same instructions to get what you want.

## Tips

Many of these tips work in combo :)

### Set the scene at the start

Give an overview at the start. Tell it what the app is about, who its for, and what the key parts are.

Example:

❌ **Don't:** be vague - `landing page`

✅ **Do:** set the scene **-** `Landing page for B2B SaaS product selling an AI app builder. Show a header, pricing options for free, pro, and enterprise, testimonials section, footer`

### Make small changes

After setting the scene, it helps to make small, iterative changes rather than sending Create tons of things to do at once.

Example:

❌ **Don't:** try to do many things all at once - `Make a social media site that lets users logs in, saves their posts, shows them in a feed, lets you like each card in the feed, and lets send invites to new friends`

✅ **Do:** break down each part:

```
Update the cards to be 12px apart in the feed 
```

```
Add a way to store posts
```

### Use Images

You can paste images into the chat. You'll get best results if you add more context with a description of what about the image you want.

<Info>
On a Mac, try Control + Command + Shift + 4 to easily save a screenshot to your clipboard- ready to paste with Command + V!

Examples:

✅ **Do:** - `Replicate this exactly: <page-image>. Details: [...more details on things you want it to copy]`

✅ **Do:** - `Make something with similar features to this: <page-image>. Details: [...more on specific things you want it to copy]`

✅ **Do:** - `Make the card look like this: <card-image>. Details: [...more details you want it to copy]`

✅ **Do:** use it to grab lots of text at once - `Fill the pricing options with all the text from this image: <image of pricing options>`

✅ **Do:** use it to gain inspiration - `Start with something that looks like this: <competitor image>. Now add: [more details]`

✅ **Do:** use it to transfer styles - `Style it like this: <image of styles>.`

### You can get very specific

To make something exact, you can even specify details like hex codes, fonts, or spacing, if you want. If you don't know, just describe in English and Create will get close.

Example:

✅ **Do:** get close in English if you don't know: `light gray subtitles that have some space between them and the title`

✅ **Do:** add hex color values: `#d3d3d3 subtitles`

✅ **Do:** add spacing or size values: `Title 32px, Subtitle 24px, with 12px space between them`

✅ **Do:** add specific Google Fonts: `Use Inter for the titles and subtitles`

### Be specific on errors

If something is not working, be very specific on what is wrong. Create can not (yet) see the app. It helps to pass it a screenshot or a tight description of what is wrong.

❌ **Don't:** vague- `It's still not working. Ugh`

✅ **Do:** specific error: `When I click on the button, it's not leading to the next page`

❌ **Don't:** vague- `Nothing works!`

✅ **Do:** specific error: `The screen is blank. Why is that and how can I fix it?`

If you see a error message, you can often just paste it back into the chat to give Create more context.

### Avoid "too long" → break into components

As your project grows long, Create can sometimes have a harder time making changes. You can combat this by breaking your project into more elements ([components](/builder/components), [functions](/builder/functions), etc).
