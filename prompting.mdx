Create understands both **text** and **images** to build your application. Clear, specific instructions yield better results and faster development than traditional coding.

<Info>
  **Prompting** refers to writing instructions for AI models. Since AI can make mistakes, the quality of your instructions significantly impacts the results you receive.

## Best practices

Combine these techniques for optimal results.

### Set clear context

❌ **Avoid:** vague descriptions - `landing page`

✅ **Use:** specific context and goals:

```
Landing page for B2B SaaS product selling an AI app builder. Show a header, pricing options for free, pro, and enterprise, testimonials section, footer
```

### Make incremental changes

❌ **Avoid:** complex multi-step requests - `Make a social media site that lets users logs in, saves their posts, shows them in a feed, lets you like each card in the feed, and lets send invites to new friends`

✅ **Use:** step-by-step approach:

```
Update the cards to be 12px apart in the feed 
```

```
Add a way to store posts
```

### Leverage images

Paste images directly into the chat for visual reference. Add context to describe what aspects of the image you want to incorporate.

<Info>
  On Mac, use Control + Command + Shift + 4 to save a screenshot to your clipboard, then paste with Command + V.
</Info>

### Image usage examples

✅ **Exact replication** (may require multiple iterations):

```
Replicate this exactly: <page-image>. Details: [...more details on things you want it to copy]
```

✅ **Similar features:**

```
Make something with similar features to this: <page-image>. Details: [...more on specific things you want it to copy]
```

✅ **Style specific elements:**

```
Make the card look like this: <card-image>. Details: [...more details you want it to copy]
```

✅ **Extract content:**

```
Fill the pricing options with all the text from this image: <image of pricing options>
```

✅ **Use for inspiration:**

```
Start with something that looks like this: <competitor image>. Now add: [more details]
```

✅ **Apply styling:**

```
Style it like this: <image of styles>.
```

### Use discussion mode

- Plan your project before building to ensure the AI has a clear roadmap
- Switch to discussion mode when debugging to investigate without making changes

### Deep thinking mode

Engage additional AI resources for critical thinking, strategy development, and research on best practices for your target audience and market segment.

### Specify details precisely

You can specify exact values like hex codes, fonts, or spacing for precise results. If you're unsure, describe in plain English and Create will approximate.

### Examples

✅ **Approximate with English:**

```
light gray subtitles that have some space between them and the title
```

✅ **Specify exact values:**

```
#d3d3d3 subtitles
```

```
Title 32px, Subtitle 24px, with 12px space between them
```

```
Use Inter for the titles and subtitles
```

### Report errors specifically

<Tip>
  The AI builder attempts to help recover from errors by providing specific information automatically. You can also check error logs directly in your dashboard via the bottom right corner.
</Tip>

❌ **Avoid:** vague complaints - `It's still not working. Ugh`

✅ **Use:** specific descriptions:

```
When I click on the button, it's not leading to the next page
```

❌ **Avoid:** general statements - `Nothing works!`

✅ **Use:** detailed explanations:

```
The screen is blank. Why is that and how can I fix it?
```

❌ **Avoid:** unclear issues - `The date picker is wrong`

✅ **Use:** contextual details:

```
This date picker [screenshot] is showing 1/9/2025 when I select 1/10/2025. Can you fix it?
```

❌ **Avoid:** incomplete descriptions - `The back button isn't working`

✅ **Use:** comprehensive context:

```
When I hit the 'manage teachers' button [screenshot] it should take me back to [page name/route] right now, nothing is happening when I click it
```

Paste error messages directly into the chat to provide additional context.

### Reference previous versions

Create maintains knowledge of your previous versions. Reference specific functionality you want to restore.

```
In a previous version, the paste image when the page was selected worked. It's now not working. 

Figure out how to bring that back. 
```

### Global prompting

Create can make changes across your entire project in parallel and create new elements as needed.

### Add multiple elements

✅ **Create new elements across your application:**

```
Make a dashboard with table, nav, and search. Also have an about page in the nav
```

This creates or updates:

- Dashboard (page)
- Table (component)
- Nav (component)
- Search (component)
- About (page)

### Handle element interactions

✅ **Manage page navigation:**

```
On the about page the back button should go to the home page
```

This will:

- Update the linking on the back button in the about page
- Get the route from the home page

### Refactor complex pages

✅ **Break down into components:**

```
Turn this dashboard page into separate components
```

This will:

- Break down the page into separate components
- Create new components as needed
- Update the page to use the new components

### Connect data across pages

✅ **Manage data flow:**

```
Store data in /database when the user enters the form on the dashboard page. When you tap an element in the table, show that info in the details page
```

This handles:

- Database queries on multiple pages
- Routing between pages
- Passing data via query params

### Apply consistent styling

✅ **Style across components:**

```
Make everything look more like this for style: <screenshot>
```

This will:

- Update the dashboard page to match the screenshot
- Update all components used on the dashboard page to match the new style

### Target specific elements

Reference individual pages or elements by name for focused changes.

✅ **Style specific elements:**

```
Make the user account page look like this: <screenshot>
```

✅ **Debug specific functionality:**

```
This function isn't returning the right data. I expect it to take in Y and return Z
```

✅ **Add focused features:**

```
Add a date picker to this form that only allows dates in the next 30 days
```
