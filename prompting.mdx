Create understands both **text** and **images** to build your app. You'll get better results if you're clear. Soon, you'll notice it's way faster than coding.

<Info>
**Prompting** is a fancy word for "writing instructions to an AI". AI models can make mistakes, so there are better and worse ways to write the same instructions to get what you want.

## Tips

Many of these tips work in combo :)

### Set the scene at the start

❌ **Don't:** be vague - `landing page`

✅ **Do:** set a clear context and goals:
```
Landing page for B2B SaaS product selling an AI app builder. Show a header, pricing options for free, pro, and enterprise, testimonials section, footer
```

### Make small changes

❌ **Don't:** try to do many things all at once - `Make a social media site that lets users logs in, saves their posts, shows them in a feed, lets you like each card in the feed, and lets send invites to new friends`

✅ **Do:** break down complex tasks into smaller steps:
```
Update the cards to be 12px apart in the feed 
```

```
Add a way to store posts
```

### Use Images

You can paste images into the chat. You'll get best results if you add more context with a description of what about the image you want.

<Info>
On a Mac, try Control + Command + Shift + 4 to easily save a screenshot to your clipboard- ready to paste with Command + V!
</Info>

Examples:

✅ **Do:** replicate exactly (might require multiple passes / images):
```
Replicate this exactly: <page-image>. Details: [...more details on things you want it to copy]
```

✅ **Do:** make something similar:
```
Make something with similar features to this: <page-image>. Details: [...more on specific things you want it to copy]
```

✅ **Do:** style specific elements:
```
Make the card look like this: <card-image>. Details: [...more details you want it to copy]
```

✅ **Do:** extract text content:
```
Fill the pricing options with all the text from this image: <image of pricing options>
```

✅ **Do:** use for inspiration:
```
Start with something that looks like this: <competitor image>. Now add: [more details]
```

✅ **Do:** apply styles:
```
Style it like this: <image of styles>.
```

### You can get very specific

To make something exact, you can even specify details like hex codes, fonts, or spacing, if you want. If you don't know, just describe in English and Create will get close.

Example:

✅ **Do:** get close in English if you don't know: 

```
light gray subtitles that have some space between them and the title
```

✅ **Do:** get specific on values  

```
#d3d3d3 subtitles
```

```
Title 32px, Subtitle 24px, with 12px space between them
```

```
Use Inter for the titles and subtitles
```

### Be specific on errors

❌ **Don't:** vague- `It's still not working. Ugh`

✅ **Do:** describe the exact issue:

```
When I click on the button, it's not leading to the next page
```

❌ **Don't:** vague- `Nothing works!`

✅ **Do:** explain the specific problem:

```
The screen is blank. Why is that and how can I fix it?
```

If you see a error message, you can often just paste it back into the chat to give Create more context.

### Avoid "too long" → break into components

As your project grows long, Create can sometimes have a harder time making changes. You can combat this by breaking your project into more elements ([components](/builder/components), [functions](/builder/functions), etc).
